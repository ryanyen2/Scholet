Previous work in HCI has used the Theory of Affordances to explain how users understand the possibilities for action in digital environments. A complementary theory from cognitive neuroscience, Technical Reasoning, posits that users accumulate abstract knowledge of object properties and technical principles known as mechanical knowledge, essential in tool use. Drawing from this theory, we introduce interaction knowledge as the \u201cmechanical\u201d knowledge of digital environments. We provide evidence of its relevance by reporting on an experiment where participants performed tasks in a digital environment with ambiguous possibilities for interaction. We analyze how interaction knowledge was transferred across two digital domains, text editing and graphical editing, and conclude that interaction knowledge models an essential type of knowledge for interacting in the digital world.", "venue": "International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems", "year": 2023, "referenceCount": 43, "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"authorId": "1666628811", "name": "Miguel A.

We have worked extensively with \" extreme \" users who need such environments to deal with large and complex datasets, using participatory design to understand their need and prototype solutions. Our WILD 1 room [5] features a 130-million pixel wall-sized display made of 32 30 \" monitors and powered by a 16-computer cluster, a 10-camera VICON motion tracking system, an FTIR tabletop and a variety of devices such as tablets, smartphones and wireless pointing devices. WILD is part of a network of 10 interactive rooms developed by the Digiscope project. All rooms feature large display surfaces and rich interaction devices. Two are immersive CAVEs; the others feature power walls with varying resolutions and sizes. Some have 3D capability; others are touch-enabled. The 10 rooms are interconnected with a telepresence system designed to support rich remote collaboration. This unique infrastructure provides us with a rich testbed for experimenting with interaction techniques and interaction models for distributed interfaces. It also raises challenging technical issues for environments where devices interoperate smoothly and where configurations can be easily defined, stored and recalled.", "venue": "", "year": 2015, "referenceCount": 11, "citationCount": 1, "authors": [{"authorId": "1401678555", "name": "M.

This leads to a generalization of the 2D Index of Difficulty of Accot and Zhai that takes movement direction into account to predict pointing time using Fitts' law.", "venue": "International Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces", "year": 2008, "referenceCount": 21, "citationCount": 45, "authors": [{"authorId": "1802574", "name": "Caroline Appert"}, {"authorId": "3342979", "name": "O.

We unobtrusively collected kinematic data from 24 users over several months, and segmented it into a table of 2 million movements. We show that Fitts' law is indeed robust for modeling pointing performance, provided that an adequate noise reduction process is applied. We introduce the length-distance index (LDI) to take into account the fact that many movements are not straight, and we introduce an extension of Fitts' law that includes an LDI term. We also show evidence of the effect of cognitive tasks in pause and click time, and the sensitivity of differences in performance, e.g., across input devices, to LDI.

Second, the platform makes it possible to explore, with semantic zooming, the 150,000 verses that comprise the complete works of William Shakespeare. We argue that reaching and selecting one specific verse in this very large text corpus amounts to a perfectly well defined Fitts task, leading to rigorous assessments of target acquisition performance. For lack of a standard, the various multiscale techniques that have been reported recently in the literature are difficult to compare.

The workshop is organized around two main activities: presenting current research by the participants and discussing directions for future research. DESCRIPTION This workshop addresses the problem of explicitly incorporating context throughout all aspects of interactive system design. The term \u201csituated computing\u201d describes socio-technical systems in which situations of use and context play a central role in the use of computers. Since most computing is arguably situated computing, we need to reflect on our current understanding of context, establish a common language for discussion and define processes for developing \"systems-in-use\". Levels of context Context operates at the physical, human, social and organizational levels: Physical context The form factor of computers directly reflects the physical context of their use. While a desktop computer may be appropriate on a desk, other shapes, such as PDAs or wearable computers, are more suitable for other situations. Augmented reality, for example, merges computers with ordinary physical objects. By blurring the limits between what is and what is not a computer, it seeks to better integrate the physical and computational worlds. Human context Computers are used by people: They must be designed to take advantage of human characteristics. Today's interfaces exploit only a small fraction of human capabilities, overloading the visual channel while virtually ignoring audio and tactile feedback and reducing the flexibility and virtuosity of the human body to tapping keys and pointing. At the cognitive level, computers should complement inadequate skills, such as short-term memory, without trying to take over intellectual skills requiring human judgment. People act within an implicit context that affects patterns of work in complex ways. Computers should respond flexibly, allowing users to react and shape the current context, without having to explicitly define it in the computer's terms. Social context Most computer systems were designed for single users, even though much work is done in a group: sharing data, exchanging documents, and communicating with each other. CSCW and groupware systems have had little impact on the corporate world, mostly because they fail to account for the real needs of users in a social context. Social interaction is characterized by a variety of communication patterns and substrates, formal or informal, synchronous or asynchronous, direct or mediated, which are often implicit. Current technology gets in the way of social interaction because it forces explicit actions from the user. For example, our peripheral awareness helps us monitor and react to what is happening in the environment. Few computer systems support, much less enhance, peripheral interaction. Organizational context Organizations, and the work practices within them, evolve constantly in the face of a changing environment. Many computer-based workflow systems have failed, not because they cannot accommodate officially-sanctioned models of work, but because they no longer support informal, user-created work patterns. Their rigidity forces users to develop complex workarounds, \"making the possible impossible\", or costing time and defeating the purpose of the system. The challenge is to design computer", "venue": "", "year": 2000, "referenceCount": 88, "citationCount": 0, "authors": [{"authorId": "1401678555", "name": "M.

We show that the power of these principles lies in their combination. Reification creates new objects that can be acted upon by a small set of polymorphic commands, creating more opportunities for reuse. The result is a simpler yet more powerful interface.\n To validate these principles, we describe their application in the redesign of a complex interface for editing and simulating Coloured Petri Nets.

This results in high de- sign, development and maintenance costs and encourages the development of stereotyped applications based on buttons, menus and dialogue boxes instead of direct manipulation of the applications objects. There have been several attempts to provide high level tools for building such applications, including popular toolkits such as Garnet [26], Unidraw [33], Fresco [21, 32] and Open- Inventor [28]. Unfortunately, these tools are not adapted to the development of sophisticated graphical editors because of their lack of extensibility: In this article we argue that these drawbacks come from the fact that high-level toolkits rely on a visualization model to manage interaction. We introduce a model that uses several graphical layers to separate the graphic entities involved in visualization from those involved in feedback and interaction management. We describe the implementation of this Multi- Layer Model and we show how it can take advantage of soft- ware and hardware graphic extensions to provide good per- formance.

Now that mice and graphics displays are everywhere, the workstation defines the frontier between the computer world and the real world. We spend a lot of time and energy transferring information between those two worlds. This could be reduced by better integrating the real world with the computer world. This article describes two approaches to this integration: Mediaspaces , which allow people to communicate through an audio, video and computer environment, and Augmented Reality , which adds computational power to real world objects. The argument is made that the success of these approaches lies in their ability to build on fundamental human skills, namely the ability to communicate with other people and the ability to interact with objects in the real world.

Introduction Over the last decade, computers have evolved from mainframes to networks of personal computers and workstations. The range of users and uses of computers has expanded dramatically. Today, a computer is perceived more as an appliance than as a \u2018machine\u2019. A key aspect of this evolution has been, and still is, the development of the field of Human-Computer Interaction. HCI has complemented, and sometimes driven, the evolution of the technology to make computer systems easier to use by a wider variety of users in a larger number of contexts.

This model uses simple rules for detecting the user's intention to address a gestural command to the system. Some rules are embedded in the model, while others are part of a set of guidelines for designing gestural command sets. Using this model, we have designed an application that allows a user to give a lecture by navigating through a set of slides with gestural commands. From the results of a usability testing of this application, we present other potential applications and directions for future work. This research aims at providing usable applications of hand gesture input in the real world. The results presented in this paper are of interest to researchers working on new interaction techniques based on gestures as well as designers of actual systems.
