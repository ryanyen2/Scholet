Previous work in HCI has used the Theory of Affordances to explain how users understand the possibilities for action in digital environments. A complementary theory from cognitive neuroscience, Technical Reasoning, posits that users accumulate abstract knowledge of object properties and technical principles known as mechanical knowledge, essential in tool use. Drawing from this theory, we introduce interaction knowledge as the “mechanical” knowledge of digital environments. We provide evidence of its relevance by reporting on an experiment where participants performed tasks in a digital environment with ambiguous possibilities for interaction. We analyze how interaction knowledge was transferred across two digital domains, text editing and graphical editing, and conclude that interaction knowledge models an essential type of knowledge for interacting in the digital world.",International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2023,43,1,"[{'authorId': '1666628811', 'name': 'Miguel A.

This approach makes the concept of application unnecessary. Instead, it leads to flexible and extensible environments in which users can combine content at will and choose the tools they need to manipulate it. We present Stratify, a proof-of-concept implementation that combines a data-reactive approach to specify relationships among digital objects with a functional-reactive approach to handle interaction. This combination enables the creation of rich information substrates that can be freely inspected and modified, as well as interaction instruments that are decoupled from the objects they interact with, making it possible to use instruments with objects they were not designed for. We illustrate the flexibility of the approach with several examples and present directions for future work.",Interaction Homme-Machine,2023,52,0,"[{'authorId': '1401678555', 'name': 'M.

We collected 62 projections from the literature and from a design workshop and found that 60% of them can be implemented using a table, a graph or a form. However, projections are often hardcoded for specific languages and situations, and in most cases only the developers of a code editor can create or adapt projections, leaving no room for appropriation by their users. We introduce lorgnette, a new framework for letting programmers augment their code editor with projections. We demonstrate five examples that use lorgnette to create projections that can be reused in new contexts.

It introduces and motivates Bayesian modelling and illustrates how powerful these ideas can be in thinking about human-computer interaction, especially in representing and manipulating uncertainty. Bayesian methods are increasingly practical as computational tools to implement them become more widely available, and offer a principled foundation to reason about interaction design. The book opens with a self-contained tutorial on Bayesian concepts and their practical implementation, tailored for the background and needs of interaction designers.

By modeling the use of objects as tools based on their abstract properties, this theory explains how tools can be re-purposed beyond their assigned function. This paper assesses the relevance of Technical Reasoning to digital tool use. We conducted an experiment with 16 participants that forced them to re-purpose commands to complete a text layout task. We analyzed self-reported scores of creative personality and experience with text editing, and found a significant association between re-purposing performance and creativity, but not with experience. Our results suggest that while most participants engaged in Technical Reasoning to re-purpose digital tools, some experienced “functional fixedness.” This work contributes Technical Reasoning as a theoretical model for the design of digital tools.",International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2022,46,3,"[{'authorId': '1666628811', 'name': 'Miguel A.

Reinforcement Learning-based Method for High-Accuracy Target Selection on Touchscreens,"Suggesting multiple target candidates based on touch input is a possible option for high-accuracy target selection on small touchscreen devices. But it can become overwhelming if suggestions are triggered too often. To address this, we propose SATS, a Suggestion-based Accurate Target Selection method, where target selection is formulated as a sequential decision problem. The objective is to maximize the utility: the negative time cost for the entire target selection procedure. The SATS decision process is dictated by a policy generated using reinforcement learning. It automatically decides when to provide suggestions and when to directly select the target. Our user studies show that SATS reduced error rate and selection time over Shift [51], a magnification-based method, and MUCS, a suggestion-based alternative that optimizes the utility for the current selection. SATS also significantly reduced error rate over BayesianCommand [58], which directly selects targets based on posteriors, with only a minor increase in selection time.",International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2022,61,3,"[{'authorId': '2127157869', 'name': 'Zhi Li'}, {'authorId': '2124975013', 'name': 'Maozheng Zhao'}, {'authorId': '2163710078', 'name': 'Dibyendu Das'}, {'authorId': '2146232456', 'name': 'Hang Zhao'}, {'authorId': '2148987503', 'name': 'Yan Ma'}, {'authorId': '2116007632', 'name': 'Wanyu Liu'}, {'authorId': '1401678555', 'name': 'M.

Our interviews with 11 LaTeX users highlighted their difficulties dealing with textually-encoded abstractions and with the mappings between source code and document output. To address some of these issues, we introduce Transitional Representations for document description languages, which enable the visualisation and manipulation of fragments of code in relation to their generated output. We present i-LaTeX, a LaTeX editor equipped with Transitional Representations of formulae, tables, images, and grid layouts.

We explore the effects of movement sonification and users’ musical background on motor variability in complex gesture learning. We contribute an empirical study in which musicians and non-musicians learn two gesture sequences over three days, with and without movement sonification. Results show the interlaced interaction effects of these factors and how they unfold in the three-day learning process. For gesture 1, which is fast and dynamic with a direct “action-sound” sonification, movement sonification induces higher variability for both musicians and non-musicians on day 1. While musicians reduce this variability to a similar level as no auditory feedback condition on day 2 and day 3, non-musicians remain to have significantly higher variability. Across three days, musicians also have significantly lower variability than non-musicians. For gesture 2, which is slow and smooth with an “action-music” metaphor, there are virtually no effects. Based on these findings, we recommend future studies to take into account participants’ musical background, consider longitudinal study to examine these effects on complex gestures, and use awareness when interpreting the results given a specific design of gesture and sound.",ACM Transactions on Applied Perception,2022,91,4,"[{'authorId': '2116007632', 'name': 'Wanyu Liu'}, {'authorId': '2149127934', 'name': 'Michelle Agnes Magalhaes'}, {'authorId': '1732917', 'name': 'W.

We compare three sonification strategies through a structured observation study with two professional aerial hoop performers.

Different sound designs affect their movement differently, and auditory feedback, regardless of type of sound, improves movement quality.

In this paper, we introduce BayesGaze, a Bayesian approach of determining the selected target given an eye-gaze trajectory. This approach views each sampling point in an eye-gaze trajectory as a signal for selecting a target. It then uses the Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability of selecting a target given a sampling point, and accumulates the posterior probabilities weighted by sampling interval to determine the selected target. The selection results are fed back to update the prior distribution of targets, which is modeled by a categorical distribution. Our investigation shows that BayesGaze improves target selection accuracy and speed over a dwell-based selection method, and the Center of Gravity Mapping (CM) method.

Its application to HCI is controversial: Some believe that the law does not apply to HCI tasks, others regard it as the cornerstone of interface design. The law, however, is often misunderstood. We review the choice-reaction time literature and argue that: (1) Hick's law speaks against, not for, the popular principle that 'less is better'; (2) logarithmic growth of observed temporal data is not necessarily interpretable in terms of Hick's law; (3) the stimulus-response paradigm is rarely relevant to HCI tasks, where choice-reaction time can often be assumed to be constant; and (4) for user interface design, a detailed examination of the effects on choice-reaction time of psychological processes such as visual search and decision making is more fruitful than a mere reference to Hick's law.",International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2020,54,7,"[{'authorId': '2116007632', 'name': 'Wanyu Liu'}, {'authorId': '10760519', 'name': 'Julien Gori'}, {'authorId': '1755659', 'name': 'O.

We introduce FileWeaver, a system that automatically detects dependencies among files without explicit user action, tracks their history, and lets users interact directly with the graphs representing these dependencies and version history. Changes to a file can trigger recipes, either automatically or under user control, to keep the file consistent with its dependants. Users can merge variants of a file, e.g. different output formats, into a polymorphic file, or morph, and automate the management of these variants.

Current mechanisms for embedding interaction in software promote a hard separation between the programmers who produce the software, and the communities who go on to use it. In order to support open ecologies of function and fabrication, where this separation is negotiated by communities of users and designers, we need to reconceive those mechanisms. We describe interaction in two phases: Co-occurrence, the prerequisite conditions for an interaction to take place; and entanglement, the temporary coupling and interplay between elements participating in the interaction. We then sketch a blueprint of a system where those phases and their adjacent mechanisms enable communities of users to build and use interactive software. There are many ways of conceiving this new design space, and we present three dominant metaphors which we have employed so far, based on chemical reactions, quantum physics and cooking. We exhibit different systems which we have implemented based on these metaphors, and sketch how future systems will further empower citizens to design and inhabit their own interactions, express ownership over them and share them with communities of interest.","International Conference on the Art, Science and Engineering of Programming",2018,21,6,"[{'authorId': '3143641', 'name': 'Antranig Basman'}, {'authorId': '10741969', 'name': 'Philip Tchernavskij'}, {'authorId': '2057224507', 'name': 'Simon Bates'}, {'authorId': '1401678555', 'name': 'M.

We analyze a case study of the validation of Fitts' law in eye-gaze movements, where an unfortunate experimental design has misled researchers into believing that eye-gaze movements are not ballistic.

We conducted three studies to understand the mismatches between their processes, tools and representations. Based on 16 interviews, we found that current practices induce unnecessary rework and cause discrepancies between the original design and the implementation. We identified three key design breakdowns where designers omitted critical details, ignored the presence of edge cases or disregarded technical limitations. We next observed two face-to-face meetings between designers and developers. We found that early involvement of the developer helped to mitigate potential design breakdowns but new ones emerged as the project unfolded. Finally, we ran a participatory design session with two designer/developer pairs. Both pairs had difficulty representing and communicating pre-existing interactions. Creating complete interaction descriptions required iterating from individual examples to rule-based representations. We conclude with implications for designing collaborative tools that facilitate the designer's ability to express and the developer's ability to implement complex interactive systems.",Conference on Computer Supported Cooperative Work,2017,34,27,"[{'authorId': '25226061', 'name': 'Nolwenn Maudet'}, {'authorId': '145479124', 'name': 'Germán Leiva'}, {'authorId': '1401678555', 'name': 'M.

We then ran a field study (n=14), beginning with in-depth observations during an operating system upgrade, followed by a four-week diary study. Very few participants prepared for upgrades (e.g., backing up files), and over half had negative reactions to the upgrade process and other changes (e.g., bugs, lost settings, unwanted features). During the upgrade process, waiting times were too long, feedback was confusing or misleading, and few had clear mental models of what was happening. Users almost never mentioned security as a concern or reason for upgrading. By contrast, interviews (n=3) with technical staff responsible for one organization's upgrades focused only on security and licensing, not user interface changes.

Observational studies of such settings have shown that users adopt a range of collaboration styles, from loosely to closely coupled.

In this paper, we operationalize five collaborative situations with increasing levels of coupling, and test the effects of providing shared interaction support for a data manipulation task in each situation. The results show the benefits of shared interaction for close collaboration: it encourages collaborative manipulation, it is more efficient and preferred by users, and it reduces physical navigation and fatigue.

While previous work has mostly addressed search, visualization and sense-making tasks, we have designed an abstract classification task that involves explicit data manipulation. Based on our observations of real uses of a wall display, this task represents a large category of applications. We report on a controlled experiment that uses this task to compare physical navigation in front of a wall-size display with virtual navigation using pan-and-zoom on the desktop. Our main finding is a robust interaction effect between display type and task difficulty: while the desktop can be faster than the wall for simple tasks, the wall gains a sizable advantage as the task becomes more difficult. A follow-up study shows that other desktop techniques (overview+detail, lens) do not perform better than pan-and-zoom and are therefore slower than the wall for difficult tasks.",International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2014,27,85,"[{'authorId': '2116904856', 'name': 'Can Liu'}, {'authorId': '3342979', 'name': 'O.

Finger rolling provides an alternative to tapping but uses a recognition process that relies on either per-user calibration, explicit delimiters or extra hardware, making it difficult to integrate into current touch-based mobile devices. This paper introduces ThumbRock, a ready-to-use micro gesture that consists in rolling the thumb back and forth on the touchscreen. Our algorithm recognizes ThumbRocks with more than 96% accuracy without calibration nor explicit delimiter by analyzing the data provided by the touch screen with a low computational cost. The full trace of the gesture is analyzed incrementally to ensure compatibility with other events and to support real-time feedback. This also makes it possible to create a continuous control space as we illustrate with our MicroSlider, a 1D slider manipulated with thumb rolling gestures.",Graphics Interface,2013,25,26,"[{'authorId': '46941602', 'name': 'David Bonnet'}, {'authorId': '1802574', 'name': 'Caroline Appert'}, {'authorId': '1401678555', 'name': 'M.

Touchstone includes a design platform for exploring alternative designs of controlled laboratory experiments, a run platform for running subjects and a limited analysis platform for advice and access to on-line statistics packages. Designed for HCI researchers and their students, the goal is to facilitate the process of replicating and extending experiments in the research literature as well as creating new ones. We tested Touchstone by designing two controlled experiments. One replicates and extends a previous study of multiscale pointing interaction techniques: OrthoZoom was fastest, followed by bi-manual Pan & Zoom; SDAZ and traditional Pan & Zoom were significantly slower.

Adding hierarchical levels increases capacity, but at the expense of longer selection times and higher error rates. In this paper we introduce Extended Marking Menus, a variant of marking menus that increases their width without sacrificing performance. Extended marking menus organize the items in several rings or layers. Selection is achieved by simultaneous control of direction, as in traditional marking menus, and another dimension such as distance, speed or pressure. We examine the design space of these new menus and study the Distance Extended Marking Menu, or Dartboard Menu, in more detail. We report on two experiments, one to calibrate the sizes of the rings, the other showing that it performs faster than the Zone and Flower menus but is less accurate than the Zone menu.",,2009,16,6,"[{'authorId': '1793712', 'name': 'Mathieu Nancel'}, {'authorId': '1401678555', 'name': 'M.

This year's symposium continues its tradition of being the premier forum for innovations in the software and technology of human-computer interfaces. UIST is an intimate, single-track conference designed to make it easy to exchange both research results and implementation experiences. 
 
Last year's symposium celebrated the first 20 years of UIST. This year's symposium looks forward to the next 20 years. What will our technology interfaces look like 20 years from now? This year's keynote speakers will help us address this question. Dan Olsen, the ""father of UIST"", will kick off the conference with his perspective on the next 20 years. On Wednesday, Cynthia Breazeal will give a perspective on human-robot interaction, an upcoming field that will become important as the number of robots interacting with humans increases over the next two decades. 
 
UIST'08 attracted 177 submissions (115 papers and 62 technotes) from all over the world. The program committee accepted 34 submissions (25 papers and 9 technotes) after a thorough review process: Each submission was assigned to two program committee members, a primary and a secondary. For each submission, the primary assigned at least two external reviewers and the secondary at least one. After the reviews were received, both program committee members wrote a meta-review for every submission. Authors were then given access to their reviews and metareviews and allowed to write a short rebuttal. The program committee then met face-to-face in San Francisco on 20-21 June 2008 to examine each submission and select the best ones. Submissions were finally accepted only after the authors provided a final version that took committee members' comments into account and was approved by at least one program committee member.",ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology,2008,0,0,"[{'authorId': '2070002084', 'name': 'S.

SwingStates is based on the use of finite‐state machines specified directly in Java to describe the behavior of interactive systems. State machines can be used to redefine the behavior of existing Swing widgets or, in combination with a new canvas widget that features a rich graphical model, to create brand new widgets. SwingStates also supports arbitrary input devices to implement novel interaction techniques based, for example, on bi‐manual or pressure‐sensitive input. We have used SwingStates in several Master's‐level classes over the past two years and have developed a benchmark approach to evaluate the toolkit in this context. The results demonstrate that SwingStates can be used by non‐expert developers with little training to successfully implement advanced interaction techniques.

We present Push Menu, an extension of Marking Menu that takes advantage of pressure input as a third input dimension to increase menu breadth. We present the results of a preliminary experiment that validates our design and shows that Push Menu users who are neither familiar with pen-based interfaces nor continuous pressure control can handle up to 20 items reliably. We also discuss the implications of these results for using Push Menu in user in- terfaces and for improving its design.",,2008,10,6,"[{'authorId': '1809689', 'name': 'Stéphane Huot'}, {'authorId': '1793712', 'name': 'Mathieu Nancel'}, {'authorId': '1401678555', 'name': 'M.

Screen edges can help stop cursor movements, requiring less precise movements from the user. Thus, pointing at elements located on the edges should be faster than pointing in the central screen area. This article presents two experiments to better understand the foundations of ""edge pointing"". The first study assesses several factors both on completion time and on users' mouse movements. The results highlight some weaknesses in the current design of desktop environments (such as the cursor shape) and reveal that movement direction plays an important role in users' performance. The second study quantifies the gain of edge pointing by comparing it with other models such as regular pointing and crossing. The results not only show that the gain can be up to 44%, but also reveal that movement angle has an effect on performance for all tested models. This leads to a generalization of the 2D Index of Difficulty of Accot and Zhai that takes movement direction into account to predict pointing time using Fitts' law.",International Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces,2008,21,45,"[{'authorId': '1802574', 'name': 'Caroline Appert'}, {'authorId': '3342979', 'name': 'O.

Experimental findings indicate that, in this context, pan & zoom combined with an overview is the most efficient technique of all four, and that focus + context techniques perform better than classical pan & zoom.

We unobtrusively collected kinematic data from 24 users over several months, and segmented it into a table of 2 million movements. We show that Fitts' law is indeed robust for modeling pointing performance, provided that an adequate noise reduction process is applied. We introduce the length-distance index (LDI) to take into account the fact that many movements are not straight, and we introduce an extension of Fitts' law that includes an LDI term. We also show evidence of the effect of cognitive tasks in pause and click time, and the sensitivity of differences in performance, e.g., across input devices, to LDI. Altogether, these findings provide a firm ground to better assess the validity of results obtained in the laboratory.",,2007,27,48,"[{'authorId': '3342979', 'name': 'O.

Unfortunately current programming tools make it difficult to implement advanced interaction techniques for these interfaces. This paper presents the Hierarchical State Machine Toolkit (HsmTk), a toolkit targeting the development of rich interactions. The key aspect of the toolkit is to consider interactions as first-class objects and to specify them with hierarchical state machines. This approach makes the resulting behaviors self-contained, easy to reuse and easy to modify. Interactions can be attached to graphical elements without knowing their detailed structure, supporting the parallel refinement of the graphics and the interaction.",International Working Conference on Advanced Visual Interfaces,2006,21,37,"[{'authorId': '2864180', 'name': 'R.

One noteworthy characteristic of our platform is that it allows the user not only to translate the document (for example, to pan and zoom) but also to tilt the virtual camera to obtain freely chosen perspective views of the document. Second, the platform makes it possible to explore, with semantic zooming, the 150,000 verses that comprise the complete works of William Shakespeare. We argue that reaching and selecting one specific verse in this very large text corpus amounts to a perfectly well defined Fitts task, leading to rigorous assessments of target acquisition performance. For lack of a standard, the various multiscale techniques that have been reported recently in the literature are difficult to compare. We recommend that Shakespeare's complete works, converted into a single document that can be zoomed both geometrically and semantically, be used as a benchmark to facilitate systematic experimental comparisons, using Fitts' target acquisition paradigm.",Workshop on Beyond Time and Errors: Novel Evaluation Methods for Visualization,2006,27,17,"[{'authorId': '1692155', 'name': 'Y.

We show that the current technique, which we call bitmap pointing (BMP), is often sub-optimal as it requires continuous information from the mouse while the system often just needs the discrete specification of objects. The paper introduces object pointing (OP), a novel interaction technique based on a special screen cursor that skips empty spaces, thus drastically reducing the waste of input information. We report data from 1D and 2D Fitts' law experiments showing that OP outperforms BMP and that the performance facilitation increases with the task's index of difficulty. We discuss the implementation of OP in current interfaces.",Graphics Interface,2004,17,163,"[{'authorId': '1692155', 'name': 'Y. Guiard'}, {'authorId': '2864180', 'name': 'R.

Semantic pointing uses two independent sizes for each potential target presented to the user: one size in motor space adapted to its importance for the manipulation, and one size in visual space adapted to the amount of information it conveys. This decoupling between visual and motor size is achieved by changing the control-to-display ratio according to cursor distance to nearby targets. We present a controlled experiment supporting our hypothesis that the performance of semantic pointing is given by Fitts' index of difficulty in motor rather than visual space. We apply semantic pointing to the redesign of traditional GUI widgets by taking advantage of the independent manipulation of motor and visual widget sizes.",International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2004,24,338,"[{'authorId': '2864180', 'name': 'R.

The notions of context and situations of use have been at the center of a body of recent research. The time has come to create a community around this theme and define a corresponding research agenda. The workshop is organized around two main activities: presenting current research by the participants and discussing directions for future research. DESCRIPTION This workshop addresses the problem of explicitly incorporating context throughout all aspects of interactive system design. The term “situated computing” describes socio-technical systems in which situations of use and context play a central role in the use of computers. Since most computing is arguably situated computing, we need to reflect on our current understanding of context, establish a common language for discussion and define processes for developing ""systems-in-use"". Levels of context Context operates at the physical, human, social and organizational levels: Physical context The form factor of computers directly reflects the physical context of their use. While a desktop computer may be appropriate on a desk, other shapes, such as PDAs or wearable computers, are more suitable for other situations. Augmented reality, for example, merges computers with ordinary physical objects. By blurring the limits between what is and what is not a computer, it seeks to better integrate the physical and computational worlds. Human context Computers are used by people: They must be designed to take advantage of human characteristics. Today's interfaces exploit only a small fraction of human capabilities, overloading the visual channel while virtually ignoring audio and tactile feedback and reducing the flexibility and virtuosity of the human body to tapping keys and pointing. At the cognitive level, computers should complement inadequate skills, such as short-term memory, without trying to take over intellectual skills requiring human judgment. People act within an implicit context that affects patterns of work in complex ways. Computers should respond flexibly, allowing users to react and shape the current context, without having to explicitly define it in the computer's terms. Social context Most computer systems were designed for single users, even though much work is done in a group: sharing data, exchanging documents, and communicating with each other. CSCW and groupware systems have had little impact on the corporate world, mostly because they fail to account for the real needs of users in a social context. Social interaction is characterized by a variety of communication patterns and substrates, formal or informal, synchronous or asynchronous, direct or mediated, which are often implicit. Current technology gets in the way of social interaction because it forces explicit actions from the user. For example, our peripheral awareness helps us monitor and react to what is happening in the environment. Few computer systems support, much less enhance, peripheral interaction. Organizational context Organizations, and the work practices within them, evolve constantly in the face of a changing environment. Many computer-based workflow systems have failed, not because they cannot accommodate officially-sanctioned models of work, but because they no longer support informal, user-created work patterns. Their rigidity forces users to develop complex workarounds, ""making the possible impossible"", or costing time and defeating the purpose of the system.

It covers existing interaction styles, including traditional WIMP interfaces, as well as new interaction styles such as two-handed input and augmented reality. It defines a design space for new interaction techniques and a set of properties for comparing them. Instrumental Interaction describes graphical user interfaces in terms of domain objects and interaction instruments. Interaction between users and domain objects is mediated by interaction instruments, similar to the tools and instruments we use in the real world to interact with physical objects. The article presents the model, applies it to describe and compare a number of interaction techniques, and shows how it was used to create a new interface for searching and replacing text.",International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,2000,33,616,"[{'authorId': '1401678555', 'name': 'M.

We show that the power of these principles lies in their combination. Reification creates new objects that can be acted upon by a small set of polymorphic commands, creating more opportunities for reuse. The result is a simpler yet more powerful interface.
 To validate these principles, we describe their application in the redesign of a complex interface for editing and simulating Coloured Petri Nets. The cpn2000 interface integrates floating palettes, toolglasses and marking menus in a consistent manner with a new metaphor for managing the workspace. It challenges traditional ideas about user interfaces, getting rid of pull-down menus, scrollbars, and even selection, while providing the same or greater functionality.

This results in high de- sign, development and maintenance costs and encourages the development of stereotyped applications based on buttons, menus and dialogue boxes instead of direct manipulation of the applications objects. There have been several attempts to provide high level tools for building such applications, including popular toolkits such as Garnet [26], Unidraw [33], Fresco [21, 32] and Open- Inventor [28]. Unfortunately, these tools are not adapted to the development of sophisticated graphical editors because of their lack of extensibility: In this article we argue that these drawbacks come from the fact that high-level toolkits rely on a visualization model to manage interaction. We introduce a model that uses several graphical layers to separate the graphic entities involved in visualization from those involved in feedback and interaction management. We describe the implementation of this Multi- Layer Model and we show how it can take advantage of soft- ware and hardware graphic extensions to provide good per- formance. We also show how it supports multiple input de- vices and simplifies the description of a wide variety of in- teraction styles.

Now that mice and graphics displays are everywhere, the workstation defines the frontier between the computer world and the real world. We spend a lot of time and energy transferring information between those two worlds. This could be reduced by better integrating the real world with the computer world. This article describes two approaches to this integration: Mediaspaces , which allow people to communicate through an audio, video and computer environment, and Augmented Reality , which adds computational power to real world objects. The argument is made that the success of these approaches lies in their ability to build on fundamental human skills, namely the ability to communicate with other people and the ability to interact with objects in the real world.

Introduction Over the last decade, computers have evolved from mainframes to networks of personal computers and workstations. The range of users and uses of computers has expanded dramatically. Today, a computer is perceived more as an appliance than as a ‘machine’. A key aspect of this evolution has been, and still is, the development of the field of Human-Computer Interaction. HCI has complemented, and sometimes driven, the evolution of the technology to make computer systems easier to use by a wider variety of users in a larger number of contexts.

As a consequence, such tools produce mostly static interfaces. Introducing animation by bringing graphical objects to life would allow the building of more dynamic interfaces.",International Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems,1992,0,4,"[{'authorId': '1945859', 'name': 'Stéphane Chatty'}, {'authorId': '1401678555', 'name': 'M.

This model uses simple rules for detecting the user's intention to address a gestural command to the system. Some rules are embedded in the model, while others are part of a set of guidelines for designing gestural command sets. Using this model, we have designed an application that allows a user to give a lecture by navigating through a set of slides with gestural commands. From the results of a usability testing of this application, we present other potential applications and directions for future work. This research aims at providing usable applications of hand gesture input in the real world. The results presented in this paper are of interest to researchers working on new interaction techniques based on gestures as well as designers of actual systems.

This exploration is carried out through the description of GroupDesign, a real-time multi-user drawing tool that we have developed. From the perspective of the users, we present a number of functionalities that we feel necessary in any real-time groupware system: Graphic & Audio Echo, Localization, Identification, Age, and History. From the perspective of the designer, we demonstrate the possibility of creating a multi-user application from a single-user one, and we introduce the notion of purely replicated architecture.",ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology,1992,24,158,"[{'authorId': '1401678555', 'name': 'M.

Microcomputers, on their side, implement graphic interfaces on monotasking operating systems. There are two differences between these machines: the operating system and the user interface to this operating system (the shell). Workstations still use standard shells (textual commands) but through a sophisticated graphic environment as a window manager, while microcomputers have their own graphic shell running on monotasking operating system.
In this paper we examine the features of both systems and then we present an iconic shell developed for Unix#8482;@@@@ workstations. This shell differs from existing shells because the interaction language is based on graphic manipulations, and is integrated in a multitasking environment.",Symposium on Small Systems,1988,12,4,"[{'authorId': '1401678555', 'name': 'M.

The tool, called Graffiti, maintains the display of a graph representing the data of the application. The graph can be manipulated directly by the user, Such actions are linked to application operations. This tool has two components: one to describe the layout and syntactic constraints on the graph, the other to describe the layout of the user interface and the interactive dialogue with the end user. It can be used to construct or prototype such diverse pieces of software as state diagram editors, Petri nets development utilities, network simulation systems, tools for software engineering based on dataflow diagrams, etc.<<ETX>>",[1988] Proceedings of the Twenty-First Annual Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences.
