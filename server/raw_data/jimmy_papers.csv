However, prior works lack a comprehensive evaluation of different language families, making it challenging to evaluate LLM robustness against errors in external retrieved knowledge. To overcome this, we establish NoMIRACL, a human-annotated dataset for evaluating LLM robustness in RAG across 18 typologically diverse languages. NoMIRACL includes both a non-relevant and a relevant subset. Queries in the non-relevant subset contain passages judged as non-relevant, whereas queries in the relevant subset include at least a single judged relevant passage. We measure LLM robustness using two metrics: (i) hallucination rate, measuring model tendency to hallucinate an answer, when the answer is not present in passages in the non-relevant subset, and (ii) error rate, measuring model inaccuracy to recognize relevant passages in the relevant subset. In our work, we measure robustness for a wide variety of multilingual-focused LLMs and observe that most of the models struggle to balance the two capacities. Models such as LLAMA-2, Orca-2, and FLAN-T5 observe more than an 88% hallucination rate on the non-relevant subset, whereas, Mistral overall hallucinates less, but can achieve up to a 74.9% error rate on the relevant subset. Overall, GPT-4 is observed to provide the best tradeoff on both subsets, highlighting future work necessary to improve LLM robustness.",arXiv.org,2023.0,58,3,"[{'authorId': '47583894', 'name': 'Nandan Thakur'}, {'authorId': '2275196928', 'name': 'Luiz Bonifacio'}, {'authorId': '2118895402', 'name': 'Xinyu Crystina Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2166106776', 'name': 'Odunayo Ogundepo'}, {'authorId': '2023642', 'name': 'Ehsan Kamalloo'}, {'authorId': '1419474794', 'name': 'David Alfonso-Hermelo'}, {'authorId': '2238110973', 'name': 'Xiaoguang Li'}, {'authorId': '2275118289', 'name': 'Qun Liu'}, {'authorId': '2237517964', 'name': 'Boxing Chen'}, {'authorId': '2066076226', 'name': 'Mehdi Rezagholizadeh'}, {'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

While vision--language pretrained transformers have led to significant improvements in retrieval effectiveness, existing research has relied on image-caption datasets that feature only simplistic image--text relationships and underspecified user models of retrieval tasks. To address the gap between these oversimplified settings and real-world applications for multimedia content creation, we introduce a new approach for building retrieval test collections. We leverage hierarchical structures and diverse domains of texts, styles, and types of images, as well as large-scale image--document associations embedded in Wikipedia. We formulate two tasks based on a realistic user model and validate our dataset through retrieval experiments using baseline models. AToMiC offers a testbed for scalable, diverse, and reproducible multimedia retrieval research.

Although many different approaches have been proposed to improve the effectiveness of generative retrieval, they have only been evaluated on document corpora on the order of 100k in size. We conduct the first empirical study of generative retrieval techniques across various corpus scales, ultimately scaling up to the entire MS MARCO passage ranking task with a corpus of 8.8M passages and evaluating model sizes up to 11B parameters. We uncover several findings about scaling generative retrieval to millions of passages; notably, the central importance of using synthetic queries as document representations during indexing, the ineffectiveness of existing proposed architecture modifications when accounting for compute cost, and the limits of naively scaling model parameters with respect to retrieval performance. While we find that generative retrieval is competitive with state-of-the-art dual encoders on small corpora, scaling to millions of passages remains an important and unsolved challenge. We believe these findings will be valuable for the community to clarify the current state of generative retrieval, highlight the unique challenges, and inspire new research directions.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2023.0,51,26,"[{'authorId': '1816753042', 'name': 'Ronak Pradeep'}, {'authorId': '47214884', 'name': 'Kai Hui'}, {'authorId': '143702064', 'name': 'Jai Gupta'}, {'authorId': '143828990', 'name': 'Á.

Revealing Preference Biases in Language Model Representations,"Do large language models (LLMs) exhibit sociodemographic biases, even when they decline to respond? To bypass their refusal to""speak,""we study this research question by probing contextualized embeddings and exploring whether this bias is encoded in its latent representations. We propose a logistic Bradley-Terry probe which predicts word pair preferences of LLMs from the words' hidden vectors. We first validate our probe on three pair preference tasks and thirteen LLMs, where we outperform the word embedding association test (WEAT), a standard approach in testing for implicit association, by a relative 27% in error rate. We also find that word pair preferences are best represented in the middle layers. Next, we transfer probes trained on harmless tasks (e.g., pick the larger number) to controversial ones (compare ethnicities) to examine biases in nationality, politics, religion, and gender. We observe substantial bias for all target classes: for instance, the Mistral model implicitly prefers Europe to Africa, Christianity to Judaism, and left-wing to right-wing politics, despite declining to answer. This suggests that instruction fine-tuning does not necessarily debias contextualized embeddings.

One particular API, suitable for dense retrieval, is the semantic embedding API that builds vector representations of a given text. With a growing number of APIs at our disposal, in this paper, our goal is to analyze semantic embedding APIs in realistic retrieval scenarios in order to assist practitioners and researchers in finding suitable services according to their needs. Specifically, we wish to investigate the capabilities of existing APIs on domain generalization and multilingual retrieval. For this purpose, we evaluate the embedding APIs on two standard benchmarks, BEIR, and MIRACL. We find that re-ranking BM25 results using the APIs is a budget-friendly approach and is most effective on English, in contrast to the standard practice, i.e., employing them as first-stage retrievers. For non-English retrieval, re-ranking still improves the results, but a hybrid model with BM25 works best albeit at a higher cost. We hope our work lays the groundwork for thoroughly evaluating APIs that are critical in search and more broadly, in information retrieval.",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2023.0,40,12,"[{'authorId': '2023642', 'name': 'Ehsan Kamalloo'}, {'authorId': '2118895402', 'name': 'Xinyu Crystina Zhang'}, {'authorId': '2166106776', 'name': 'Odunayo Ogundepo'}, {'authorId': '47583894', 'name': 'Nandan Thakur'}, {'authorId': '1419474794', 'name': 'David Alfonso-Hermelo'}, {'authorId': '2066076226', 'name': 'Mehdi Rezagholizadeh'}, {'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

With the onset of pre-trained transformer models such as BERT, neural sparse retrieval has led to a new paradigm within retrieval. Despite the success, there has been limited software supporting different sparse retrievers running in a unified, common environment. This hinders practitioners from fairly comparing different sparse models and obtaining realistic evaluation results. Another missing piece is, that a majority of prior work evaluates sparse retrieval models on in-domain retrieval, i.e. on a single dataset: MS MARCO. However, a key requirement in practical retrieval systems requires models that can generalize well to unseen out-of-domain, i.e. zero-shot retrieval tasks. In this work, we provide SPRINT, a unified python toolkit based on Pyserini and Lucene, supporting a common interface for evaluating neural sparse retrieval. The toolkit currently includes five built-in models: uniCOIL, DeepImpact, SPARTA, TILDEv2 and SPLADEv2. Users can also easily add customized models by defining their term weighting method. Using our toolkit, we establish strong and reproducible zero-shot sparse retrieval baselines across the well-acknowledged benchmark, BEIR. Our results demonstrate that SPLADEv2 achieves the best average score of 0.470 nDCG@10 on BEIR amongst all neural sparse retrievers. In this work, we further uncover the reasons behind its performance gain. We show that SPLADEv2 produces sparse representations with a majority of tokens outside of the original query and document which is often crucial for its performance gains, i.e. a limitation among its other sparse counterparts.

Our approaches demonstrate competitive reranking effectiveness compared to recent state-of-the-art LLM rerankers with substantially smaller models.

However, the gap between open-source and closed models persists, with reliance on proprietary, non-transparent models constraining reproducibility. Addressing this gap, we introduce RankZephyr, a state-of-the-art, open-source LLM for listwise zero-shot reranking. RankZephyr not only bridges the effectiveness gap with GPT-4 but in some cases surpasses the proprietary model. Our comprehensive evaluations across several datasets (TREC Deep Learning Tracks; NEWS and COVID from BEIR) showcase this ability. RankZephyr benefits from strategic training choices and is resilient against variations in initial document ordering and the number of documents reranked.

This suggests that, from a simple cost-benefit analysis, there does not appear to be a compelling reason to introduce a dedicated vector store into a modern""AI stack""for search, since such applications have already received substantial investments in existing, widely deployed infrastructure.",Web Search and Data Mining,2023.0,30,4,"[{'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

Existing DRs, however, often suffer from effectiveness tradeoffs between supervised and zero-shot retrieval, which some argue was due to the limited model capacity. We contradict this hypothesis and show that a generalizable DR can be trained to achieve high accuracy in both supervised and zero-shot retrieval without increasing model size. In particular, we systematically examine the contrastive learning of DRs, under the framework of Data Augmentation (DA). Our study shows that common DA practices such as query augmentation with generative models and pseudo-relevance label creation using a cross-encoder, are often inefficient and sub-optimal. We hence propose a new DA approach with diverse queries and sources of supervision to progressively train a generalizable DR. As a result, DRAGON, our dense retriever trained with diverse augmentation, is the first BERT-base-sized DR to achieve state-of-the-art effectiveness in both supervised and zero-shot evaluations and even competes with models using more complex late interaction (ColBERTv2 and SPLADE++).",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2023.0,58,25,"[{'authorId': '122045993', 'name': 'Sheng-Chieh Lin'}, {'authorId': '35584853', 'name': 'Akari Asai'}, {'authorId': '2135230554', 'name': 'Minghan Li'}, {'authorId': '9185192', 'name': 'Barlas Oğuz'}, {'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

In recent years, we have witnessed the growing popularity of a representation learning approach to building retrieval models, typically using pretrained transformers in a supervised setting. This naturally begs the question: How effective are these models when presented with queries and documents that differ from the training data? Examples include searching in different domains (e.g., medical or legal text) and with different types of queries (e.g., keywords vs. well-formed questions). While BEIR was designed to answer these questions, our work addresses two shortcomings that prevent the benchmark from achieving its full potential: First, the sophistication of modern neural methods and the complexity of current software infrastructure create barriers to entry for newcomers. To this end, we provide reproducible reference implementations that cover the two main classes of approaches: learned dense and sparse models. Second, there does not exist a single authoritative nexus for reporting the effectiveness of different models on BEIR, which has led to difficulty in comparing different methods. To remedy this, we present an official self-service BEIR leaderboard that provides fair and consistent comparisons of retrieval models.

However, there has been limited success for multilingual retrieval so far, as training data is uneven or scarcely available across multiple languages. Synthetic training data generation is promising (e.g., InPars or Promptagator), but has been investigated only for English. Therefore, to study model capabilities across both cross-lingual and monolingual retrieval tasks, we develop SWIM-IR, a synthetic retrieval training dataset containing 33 (high to very-low resource) languages for training multilingual dense retrieval models without requiring any human supervision. To construct SWIM-IR, we propose SAP (summarize-then-ask prompting), where the large language model (LLM) generates a textual summary prior to the query generation step. SAP assists the LLM in generating informative queries in the target language. Using SWIM-IR, we explore synthetic fine-tuning of multilingual dense retrieval models and evaluate them robustly on three retrieval benchmarks: XOR-Retrieve (cross-lingual), XTREME-UP (cross-lingual) and MIRACL (monolingual).

Multi-vector retrieval methods have demonstrated their effectiveness on various retrieval datasets, and among them, ColBERT is the most established method based on the late interaction of contextualized token embeddings of pre-trained language models. However, efficient ColBERT implementations require complex engineering and cannot take advantage of off-the-shelf search libraries, impeding their practical use. To address this issue, SLIM first maps each contextualized token vector to a sparse, high-dimensional lexical space before performing late interaction between these sparse token embeddings. We then introduce an efficient two-stage retrieval architecture that includes inverted index retrieval followed by a score refinement module to approximate the sparsified late interaction, which is fully compatible with off-the-shelf lexical search libraries such as Lucene. SLIM achieves competitive accuracy on MS MARCO Passages and BEIR compared to ColBERT while being much smaller and faster on CPUs.

The problem is important as it helps us identify the factors that affect individual encoders to further improve overall performance. In this paper, we formulate our analysis under a probabilistic framework called encoder marginalization, where we quantify the contribution of a single encoder by marginalizing other variables. First, we find that the passage encoder contributes more than the question encoder to in-domain retrieval accuracy. Second, we demonstrate how to find the affecting factors for each encoder, where we train DPR with different amounts of data and use encoder marginalization to analyze the results. We find that positive passage overlap and corpus coverage of training data have big impacts on the passage encoder, while the question encoder is mainly affected by training sample complexity under this setting.

In this paper, we propose the concept of certified error control of candidate set pruning for relevance ranking, which means that the test error after pruning is guaranteed to be controlled under a user-specified threshold with high probability. Both in-domain and out-of-domain experiments show that our method successfully prunes the first-stage retrieved candidate sets to improve the second-stage reranking speed while satisfying the pre-specified accuracy constraints in both settings. For example, on MS MARCO Passage v1, our method reduces the average candidate set size from 1000 to 27, increasing reranking speed by about 37 times, while keeping MRR@10 greater than a pre-specified value of 0.38 with about 90% empirical coverage.

However, storing all the document embeddings within an index produces bulky indexes which are expensive to serve. Recently, BPR (Yamada et al., 2021) and JPQ (Zhan et al., 2021a) have been proposed which train the model to produce binary document vectors, which reduce the index 32 × and more. The authors showed these binary embedding models signiﬁcantly outperform more traditional index compression techniques like Product Quantization (PQ). Previous work evaluated these approaches just in-domain, i.e. the methods were evaluated on tasks for which training data is available. In practice, retrieval models are often used in an out-of-domain setting, where they have been train on a publicly available dataset, like MS MARCO, but are then used for some custom dataset for which no training data is available. In this work, we show that binary embedding models like BPR and JPQ can perform significantly worse than baselines once there is a domain-shift involved. We propose a modiﬁ-cation to the training procedure of BPR and JPQ and combine it with a corpus speciﬁc generative procedure which allow the adaptation of BPR and JPQ to any corpus without requiring labeled training data.

This simple method is so effective that even a state-of-the-art neural relevance ranking method trained on the medical subset of MS MARCO passage, when reranking the results of NQS, fails to improve on the ranked list. Second, we introduce a two-stage neural reranking pipeline trained on clinical trial matching data using tailored ranking templates. In this setting, we can train a pointwise reranker using just 1.1k positive examples and obtain effectiveness improvements over NQS by 24 points.

In this paper, we perform a text-image attribution analysis on Stable Diffusion, a recently open-sourced model. To produce attribution maps, we upscale and aggregate cross-attention maps in the denoising module, naming our method DAAM. We validate it by testing its segmentation ability on nouns, as well as its generalized attribution quality on all parts of speech, rated by humans. On two generated datasets, we attain a competitive 58.8-64.8 mIoU on noun segmentation and fair to good mean opinion scores (3.4-4.2) on generalized attribution. Then, we apply DAAM to study the role of syntax in the pixel space across head–dependent heat map interaction patterns for ten common dependency relations. We show that, for some relations, the head map consistently subsumes the dependent, while the opposite is true for others. Finally, we study several semantic phenomena, focusing on feature entanglement; we find that the presence of cohyponyms worsens generation quality by 9%, and descriptive adjectives attend too broadly. We are the first to interpret large diffusion models from a visuolinguistic perspective, which enables future research.

Prompting GPT-3 or Codex using several examples of question-SQL pairs can produce excellent results, comparable to state-of-the-art finetuning-based models. However, existing work primarily focuses on English datasets, and it is unknown whether large language models can serve as competitive semantic parsers for other languages. To bridge this gap, our work focuses on cross-lingual Text-to-SQL semantic parsing for translating non-English utterances into SQL queries based on an English schema. We consider a zero-shot transfer learning setting with the assumption that we do not have any labeled examples in the target language (but have annotated examples in English). This work introduces the XRICL framework, which learns to retrieve relevant English exemplars for a given query to construct prompts. We also include global translation exemplars for a target language to facilitate the translation process for large language models. To systematically evaluate our model, we construct two new benchmark datasets, XSpider and XKaggle-dbqa, which include questions in Chinese, Vietnamese, Farsi, and Hindi.

However, only a handful of the 7000+ languages on the planet benefit from specialized, custom-built tokenization algorithms, while the other languages are stuck with a""default""whitespace tokenizer, which cannot capture the intricacies of different languages.

In this paper, we recognize the difficulty of zero-shot learning and encoding relevance. Instead, we propose to pivot through Hypothetical Document Embeddings (HyDE). Given a query, HyDE first zero-shot prompts an instruction-following language model (e.g., InstructGPT) to generate a hypothetical document. The document captures relevance patterns but is “fake” and may contain hallucinations. Then, an unsupervised contrastively learned encoder (e.g., Contriever) encodes the document into an embedding vector. This vector identifies a neighborhood in the corpus embedding space, from which similar real documents are retrieved based on vector similarity. This second step grounds the generated document to the actual corpus, with the encoder’s dense bottleneck filtering out the hallucinations. Our experiments show that HyDE significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised dense retriever Contriever and shows strong performance comparable to fine-tuned retrievers across various tasks (e.g. web search, QA, fact verification) and in non-English languages (e.g., sw, ko, ja, bn).",Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics,2022.0,61,89,"[{'authorId': '49715441', 'name': 'Luyu Gao'}, {'authorId': '2461713', 'name': 'Xueguang Ma'}, {'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

This “lack of readiness” results from the gap between language model pre-training and DPR fine-tuning. Previous solutions call for computationally expensive techniques such as hard negative mining, cross-encoder distillation, and further pre-training to learn a robust DPR model. In this work, we instead propose to fully exploit knowledge in a pre-trained language model for DPR by aggregating the contextualized token embeddings into a dense vector, which we call agg★.

Prior work performs hybrid retrieval by conducting lexical and semantic matching using different systems (e.g., Lucene and Faiss, respectively) and then fusing their model outputs. In contrast, our work integrates lexical representations with dense semantic representations by densifying high-dimensional lexical representations into what we call low-dimensional dense lexical representations (DLRs). Our experiments show that DLRs can effectively approximate the original lexical representations, preserving effectiveness while improving query latency. Furthermore, we can combine dense lexical and semantic representations to generate dense hybrid representations (DHRs) that are more flexible and yield faster retrieval compared to existing hybrid techniques. In addition, we explore jointly training lexical and semantic representations in a single model and empirically show that the resulting DHRs are able to combine the advantages of the individual components. Our best DHR model is competitive with state-of-the-art single-vector and multi-vector dense retrievers in both in-domain and zero-shot evaluation settings.

One recent line of research uses language models to generate query-related contexts for expansion. Along this line, we argue that expansion terms from these contexts should balance two key aspects: diversity and relevance. The obvious way to increase diversity is to sample multiple contexts from the language model. However, this comes at the cost of relevance, because there is a well-known tendency of models to hallucinate incorrect or irrelevant contexts. To balance these two considerations, we propose a combination of an effective filtering strategy and fusion of the retrieved documents based on the generation probability of each context.

Despite their empirical success in downstream tasks, there is still a gap in understanding of “what makes them tick”. In this paper, we try to understand the effects of sharing a vocabulary space on the cross-lingual abilities of a multilingual model. We train multiple monolingual and multilingual models and compare their effectiveness on downstream tasks. In monolingual models, a single language occupies the entire vocabulary space, limiting possible cross-lingual transfer. Whereas in a multi-lingual setting, the model benefits from cross-lingual transfer with the tradeoff of having to split the vocabulary space between multiple languages. We present a comprehensive study of the effects of a shared vocabulary space, cross-script pretraining, and high-resource transfer on the cross-lingual abilities of multilingual models in zero-and few-shot settings. From our study, we observe that scaling the number of languages is beneficial for cross-lingual transfer in low-resource multilingual models up until a point, after which transfer effects saturate. We find that there is not much benefit from pretraining low-resource multilingual models with a high-resource language, and that cross-lingual transfer is possible even when the languages are written with different scripts.

We perform a detailed empirical study on how the Gaussian mechanism for differential privacy and gradient compression jointly impact test accuracy in deep learning. The existing literature in gradient compression mostly evaluates compression in the absence of differential privacy guarantees, and demonstrate that sufficiently high compression rates reduce accuracy. Similarly, existing literature in differential privacy evaluates privacy mechanisms in the absence of compression, and demonstrates that sufficiently strong privacy guarantees reduce accuracy. In this work, we observe while gradient compression generally has a negative impact on test accuracy in non-private training, it can sometimes improve test accuracy in differentially private training. Specifically, we observe that when employing aggressive sparsification or rank reduction to the gradients, test accuracy is less affected by the Gaussian noise added for differential privacy. These observations are explained through an analysis how differential privacy and compression effects the bias and variance in estimating the average gradient. We follow this study with a recommendation on how to improve test accuracy under the context of differentially private deep learning and gradient compression. We evaluate this proposal and find that it can reduce the negative impact of noise added by differential privacy mechanisms on test accuracy by up to 24.6%, and reduce the negative impact of gradient sparsification on test accuracy by up to 15.1%.",arXiv.org,2022.0,26,0,"[{'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

Each of these categories appears to capture different characteristics of relevance. Previous work has investigated how relevance signals from sparse retrievers could be combined with those from dense retrievers via interpolation. Such interpolation would generally lead to higher retrieval effectiveness. In this paper we consider the problem of combining the relevance signals from sparse and dense retrievers in the context of Pseudo Relevance Feedback (PRF). This context poses two key challenges: (1) When should interpolation occur: before, after, or both before and after the PRF process?

To answer these questions we perform a thorough empirical evaluation considering an effective and scalable neural PRF approach (Vector-PRF), three effective dense retrievers (ANCE, TCTv2, DistillBERT), and one state-of-the-art learned sparse retriever (uniCOIL).

In this article, we focus on the task of monolingual retrieval in a variety of typologically diverse languages using such an architecture. Although recent work with multilingual transformers demonstrates that they exhibit strong cross-lingual generalization capabilities, there remain many open research questions, which we tackle here. Our study is organized as a “best practices” guide for training multilingual dense retrieval models, broken down into three main scenarios: when a multilingual transformer is available, but training data in the form of relevance judgments are not available in the language and domain of interest (“have model, no data”); when both models and training data are available (“have model and data”); and when training data are available but not models (“have data, no model”). In considering these scenarios, we gain a better understanding of the role of multi-stage fine-tuning, the strength of cross-lingual transfer under various conditions, the usefulness of out-of-language data, and the advantages of multilingual vs. monolingual transformers. Our recommendations offer a guide for practitioners building search applications, particularly for low-resource languages, and while our work leaves open a number of research questions, we provide a solid foundation for future work.",ACM Trans.

The corpus used in the 2021 edition of the track was much bigger than the corpus used previously and it contains many more relevant documents. The process used to select documents to judge that had been used in earlier years of the track failed to produce a reliable collection because most topics have too many relevant documents. Judgment budgets were exceeded before an adequate sample of the relevant set could be found, so there are likely many unknown relevant documents in the unjudged portion of the corpus. As a result, the collection is not reusable, and furthermore, recall-based measures are unreliable even for the retrieval systems that were used to build the collection. Yet, early-precision measures cannot distinguish among system results because the maximum score is easily obtained for many topics. And since the existing tools for appraising the quality of test collections depend on systems' scores, they also fail when there are too many relevant documents. Collection builders will need new strategies and tools for building reliable test collections for continued use of the Cranfield paradigm on ever-larger corpora. Ensuring that the definition of 'relevant' truly reflects the desired systems' rankings is a provisional strategy for continued collection building.",Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2022.0,22,13,"[{'authorId': '1746656', 'name': 'E.

At the time, they lacked the large-scale human-annotated datasets necessary to properly train their models. In this paper, we ask the simple question: What if Berger and Lafferty had access to datasets such as the MS MARCO passage ranking dataset that we take for granted today? The answer to this question tells us how much of recent improvements in ranking can be solely attributed to having more data available, as opposed to improvements in models (e.g., pretrained transformers) and optimization techniques (e.g., contrastive loss). In fact, Boytsov and Kolter recently began to answer this question with a replication of Berger and Lafferty's model, and this work can be viewed as another independent replication effort, with generalizations to additional conditions not previously explored, including replacing the sum of translation probabilities with ColBERT's MaxSim operator. We confirm that while neural models (particularly pretrained transformers) have indeed led to great advances in retrieval effectiveness, the IRST model proposed decades ago is quite effective if provided sufficient training data.",Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2022.0,28,1,"[{'authorId': '2144468595', 'name': 'Yuqi Liu'}, {'authorId': '2118956992', 'name': 'Chengcheng Hu'}, {'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

They thus provide the opportunity to empirically test the claim that pooling-built test collections can reliably evaluate retrieval systems that did not contribute to the construction of the collection (in other words, that such collections can be reusable). To test the reusability claim, we asked TREC assessors to judge new pools created from new search results for the TREC-8 ad hoc collection. These new search results consisted of five new runs (one each from three transformer-based models and two baseline runs that use BM25) plus the set of TREC-8 submissions that did not previously contribute to pools. The new runs did retrieve previously unseen documents, but the vast majority of those documents were not relevant. The ranking of all runs by mean evaluation score when evaluated using the official TREC-8 relevance judgment set and the newly expanded relevance set are almost identical, with Kendall's tau correlations greater than 0.99. Correlations for individual topics are also high. The TREC-8 ad hoc collection was originally constructed using deep pools over a diverse set of runs, including several effective manual runs. Its judgment budget, and hence construction cost, was relatively large. However, it does appear that the expense was well-spent: even with the advent of neural techniques, the collection has stood the test of time and remains a reliable evaluation instrument as retrieval techniques have advanced.",arXiv.org,2022.0,27,15,"[{'authorId': '1746656', 'name': 'E.

Many important applications, e.g., global path planning and trajectory generation in micro aerial vehicles, require the construction of large maps at high resolutions. In this work, we identify mapping, i.e., construction and updates of 3D maps to be a critical bottleneck in these applications. The memory required and access times of these maps limit the size of the environment and the resolution with which the environment can be feasibly mapped, especially in resource constrained environments such as autonomous robot platforms and portable devices. To address this challenge, we propose VoxelCache: a hardware-software technique to accelerate map data access times in 3D mapping applications. We observe that mapping applications typically access voxels in the map that are spatially co-located to each other. We leverage this temporal locality in voxel accesses to cache indices to blocks of voxels to enable quick lookup and avoid expensive access times. We evaluate VoxelCache on popularly used mapping and reconstruction applications on both GPUs and CPUs.

Despite their success, dense retrievers are expensive to serve across practical use cases. For use cases requiring to search from millions of documents, the dense index becomes bulky and requires high memory usage for storing the index. More recently, learning-to-hash (LTH) techniques, for e.g., BPR and JPQ, produce binary document vectors, thereby reducing the memory requirement to efficiently store the dense index. LTH techniques are supervised and finetune the retriever using a ranking loss. They outperform their counterparts, i.e., traditional out-of-the-box vector compression techniques such as PCA or PQ. A missing piece from prior work is that existing techniques have been evaluated only in-domain, i.e., on a single dataset such as MS MARCO. In our work, we evaluate LTH and vector compression techniques for improving the downstream zero-shot retrieval accuracy of the TAS-B dense retriever while maintaining efficiency at inference. Our results demonstrate that, unlike prior work, LTH strategies when applied naively can underperform the zero-shot TAS-B dense retriever on average by up to 14% nDCG@10 on the BEIR benchmark. To solve this limitation, in our work, we propose an easy yet effective solution of injecting domain adaptation with existing supervised LTH techniques. We experiment with two well-known unsupervised domain adaptation techniques: GenQ and GPL. Our domain adaptation injection technique can improve the downstream zero-shot retrieval effectiveness for both BPR and JPQ variants of the TAS-B model by on average 11.5% and 8.2% nDCG@10 while both maintaining 32$\times$ memory efficiency and 14$\times$ and 2$\times$ speedup respectively in CPU retrieval latency on BEIR.

While modern systems are dominated by DaaT, the academic literature has seen decades of debate about the merits of each. Recently, there has been renewed interest in SaaT methods for learned sparse lexical models, where studies have shown that transformers generate ""wacky weights"" that appear to reduce opportunities for optimizations in DaaT methods. However, researchers currently lack an easy-to-use SaaT system to support further exploration. This is the gap that our work fills. Starting with a modern SaaT system (JASS), we built Python bindings in order to integrate into the DaaT Pyserini IR toolkit (Lucene). The result is a common frontend to both a DaaT and a SaaT system. We demonstrate how recent experiments with a wide range of learned sparse lexical models can be easily reproduced.

Naturally, we may construct a pipeline of multiple efficiency methods, i.e., to apply multiple operators on the model sequentially. In this paper, we study the plausibility of this idea, and more importantly, the commutativity and cumulativeness of efficiency operators. We make two interesting observations: (1) Efficiency operators are commutative -- the order of efficiency methods within the pipeline has little impact on the final results; (2) Efficiency operators are also cumulative -- the final results of combining several efficiency methods can be estimated by combining the results of individual methods.

Previous work on generalization of DPR mainly focus on testing both encoders in tandem on out-of-distribution (OOD) question-answering (QA) tasks, which is also known as domain adaptation. However, it is still unknown how DPR's individual question/passage encoder affects generalization. Specifically, in this paper, we want to know how an in-distribution (IND) question/passage encoder would generalize if paired with an OOD passage/question encoder from another domain. We refer to this challenge as \textit{encoder adaptation}. To answer this question, we inspect different combinations of DPR's question and passage encoder learned from five benchmark QA datasets on both in-domain and out-of-domain questions. We find that the passage encoder has more influence on the lower bound of generalization while the question encoder seems to affect the upper bound in general.

As queries in information seeking dialogues are ambiguous for traditional ad hoc information retrieval (IR) systems due to the coreference and omission resolution problems inherent in natural language dialogue, resolving these ambiguities is crucial. In this article, we tackle conversational passage retrieval, an important component of conversational search, by addressing query ambiguities with query reformulation integrated into a multi-stage ad hoc IR system. Specifically, we propose two conversational query reformulation (CQR) methods: (1) term importance estimation and (2) neural query rewriting. For the former, we expand conversational queries using important terms extracted from the conversational context with frequency-based signals. For the latter, we reformulate conversational queries into natural, stand-alone, human-understandable queries with a pretrained sequence-to-sequence model. Detailed analyses of the two CQR methods are provided quantitatively and qualitatively, explaining their advantages, disadvantages, and distinct behaviors. Moreover, to leverage the strengths of both CQR methods, we propose combining their output with reciprocal rank fusion, yielding state-of-the-art retrieval effectiveness, 30% improvement in terms of NDCG@3 compared to the best submission of Text REtrieval Conference (TREC) Conversational Assistant Track (CAsT) 2019.",ACM Trans.

Unfortunately, how they make their predictions remains vastly unexplained, especially at the end-to-end, input-to-output level. Little known is how tokens, layers, and passages precisely contribute to the final prediction. In this paper, we address this gap by leveraging the recently developed information bottlenecks for attribution (IBA) framework. On BERT-based models for passage reranking, we quantitatively demonstrate the framework’s veracity in extracting attribution maps, from which we perform detailed, token-wise analysis about how predictions are made. Overall, we find that BERT still cares about exact token matching for reranking; the [CLS] token mainly gathers information for predictions at the last layer; top-ranked passages are robust to token removal; and BERT fine-tuned on MSMARCO has positional bias towards the start of the passage.",BlackboxNLP Workshop on Analyzing and Interpreting Neural Networks for NLP,2021.0,40,6,"[{'authorId': '2197574931', 'name': 'Zhiying Jiang'}, {'authorId': '26917433', 'name': 'Raphael Tang'}, {'authorId': '2059016789', 'name': 'Ji Xin'}, {'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

The advantage of the bi-encoder teacher–student setup is that we can efficiently add in-batch negatives during knowledge distillation, enabling richer interactions between teacher and student models.

The neural IR community made great advancements in training effective dual-encoder dense retrieval (DR) models recently. A dense text retrieval model uses a single vector representation per query and passage to score a match, which enables low-latency first-stage retrieval with a nearest neighbor search. Increasingly common, training approaches require enormous compute power, as they either conduct negative passage sampling out of a continuously updating refreshing index or require very large batch sizes. Instead of relying on more compute capability, we introduce an efficient topic-aware query and balanced margin sampling technique, called TAS-Balanced. We cluster queries once before training and sample queries out of a cluster per batch. We train our lightweight 6-layer DR model with a novel dual-teacher supervision that combines pairwise and in-batch negative teachers. Our method is trainable on a single consumer-grade GPU in under 48 hours. We show that our TAS-Balanced training method achieves state-of-the-art low-latency (64ms per query) results on two TREC Deep Learning Track query sets. Evaluated on NDCG@10, we outperform BM25 by 44%, a plainly trained DR by 19%, docT5query by 11%, and the previous best DR model by 5%.

By design, they sort entries into some linear order, where the top-scoring entry is recognized as the ""state of the art"" (SOTA). Due to the rapid progress being made today, particularly with neural models, the top entry in a leaderboard is replaced with some regularity. These are touted as improvements in the state of the art. Such pronouncements, however, are almost never qualified with significance testing. In the context of the MS MARCO document ranking leaderboard, we pose a specific question: How do we know if a run is significantly better than the current SOTA? Against the backdrop of recent IR debates on scale types, our study proposes an evaluation framework that explicitly treats certain outcomes as distinct and avoids aggregating them into a single-point metric. Empirical analysis of SOTA runs from the MS MARCO document ranking leaderboard reveals insights about how one run can be ""significantly better"" than another that are obscured by the current official evaluation metric (MRR@100).",Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2021.0,18,16,"[{'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

Misinformation has real consequences for consumer health search, i.e., users searching for health information. In the context of multi-stage ranking architectures, there has been little work exploring whether they prioritize correct and credible information over misinformation. We find that, indeed, training models on standard relevance ranking datasets like MS MARCO passage---which have been curated to contain mostly credible information---yields models that might also promote harmful misinformation. To rectify this, we propose a label prediction technique that can separate helpful from harmful content. Our design leverages pretrained sequence-to-sequence transformer models for both relevance ranking and label prediction. Evaluated at the TREC 2020 Health Misinformation Track, our techniques represent the top-ranked system: Our best submitted run was 19.2 points higher than the second-best run based on the primary metric, a 68% relative improvement.

In this work, we show that it is possible to retain the benefits of transformer-based rerankers in a multi-stage reranking pipeline by first using feature-based learning-to-rank techniques to reduce the number of candidate documents under consideration without adversely affecting their quality in terms of recall. Applied to the MS MARCO passage and document ranking tasks, we are able to achieve the same level of effectiveness, but with up to 18× increase in efficiency. Furthermore, our techniques are orthogonal to other methods focused on accelerating transformer inference, and thus can be combined for even greater efficiency gains.

Previous studies comparing document-at-a-time and score-at-a-time approaches have consistently found that the former approach yields lower mean query latency, although the latter approach has more predictable query latency. In our experiments with four different retrieval models that exploit representational learning with bags of words, we find that transformers generate""wacky weights""that appear to greatly reduce the opportunities for skipping and early exiting optimizations that lie at the core of standard document-at-a-time techniques. As a result, score-at-a-time approaches appear to be more competitive in terms of query evaluation latency than in previous studies.

However, these models are known to require a lot of training data. This consequently leaves out a huge percentage of the world’s languages as they are under-resourced. Furthermore, a major motivation behind these models is that lower-resource languages benefit from joint training with higher-resource languages. In this work, we challenge this assumption and present the first attempt at training a multilingual language model on only low-resource languages. We show that it is possible to train competitive multilingual language models on less than 1 GB of text.

Evaluations on named entity recognition and text classification spanning 10 languages show that our model outperforms mBERT and XLM-Rin several languages and is very competitive overall.

I propose a representational approach that breaks the core text retrieval problem into a logical scoring model and a physical retrieval model. The scoring model is defined in terms of encoders, which map queries and documents into a representational space, and a comparison function that computes query-document scores. The physical retrieval model defines how a system produces the top-k scoring documents from an arbitrarily large corpus with respect to a query. The scoring model can be further analyzed along two dimensions: dense vs. sparse representations and supervised (learned) vs. unsupervised approaches. I show that many recently proposed retrieval methods, including multi-stage ranking designs, can be seen as different parameterizations in this framework, and that a unified view suggests a number of open research questions, providing a roadmap for future work.

It aims to provide effective, reproducible, and easy-to-use first-stage retrieval in a multi-stage ranking architecture. Our toolkit is self-contained as a standard Python package and comes with queries, relevance judgments, pre-built indexes, and evaluation scripts for many commonly used IR test collections. We aim to support, out of the box, the entire research lifecycle of efforts aimed at improving ranking with modern neural approaches. In particular, Pyserini supports sparse retrieval (e.g., BM25 scoring using bag-of-words representations), dense retrieval (e.g., nearest-neighbor search on transformer-encoded representations), as well as hybrid retrieval that integrates both approaches. This paper provides an overview of toolkit features and presents empirical results that illustrate its effectiveness on two popular ranking tasks.

Prior to our work, the state-of-the-art approach uses a multi-stage pipeline comprising conversational query reformulation and information retrieval modules. Despite its effectiveness, such a pipeline often includes multiple neural models that require long inference times. In addition, independently optimizing each module ignores dependencies among them. To address these shortcomings, we propose to integrate conversational query reformulation directly into a dense retrieval model. To aid in this goal, we create a dataset with pseudo-relevance labels for conversational search to overcome the lack of training data and to explore different training strategies. We demonstrate that our model effectively rewrites conversational queries as dense representations in conversational search and open-domain question answering datasets. Finally, after observing that our model learns to adjust the L2 norm of query token embeddings, we leverage this property for hybrid retrieval and to support error analysis.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2021.0,36,36,"[{'authorId': '122045993', 'name': 'Sheng-Chieh Lin'}, {'authorId': '2109723027', 'name': 'Jheng-Hong Yang'}, {'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

However, Karpukhin et al. (2020) shows that jointly learning different QA tasks with one dense model is not always beneﬁcial due to corpus inconsistency. For example, SQuAD only focuses on a small set of Wikipedia articles while datasets like NQ and Trivia cover more entries, and joint training on their union can cause performance degradation. To solve this problem, we propose to train individual dense passage retrievers (DPR) for different tasks and aggregate their predictions during test time, where we use uncertainty estimation as weights to indicate how probable a speciﬁc query belongs to each expert’s expertise. Our method reaches state-of-the-art performance on 5 benchmark QA datasets, with up to 10% improvement in top-100 accuracy compared to a joint-training multi-task DPR on SQuAD.

Although the most common formulation of text ranking is search, instances of the task can also be found in many text processing applications. This tutorial provides an overview of text ranking with neural network architectures known as transformers, of which BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is the best-known example. These models produce high quality results across many domains, tasks, and settings. This tutorial, which is based on the preprint of a forthcoming book to be published by Morgan and & Claypool under the Synthesis Lectures on Human Language Technologies series, provides an overview of existing work as a single point of entry for practitioners who wish to deploy transformers for text ranking in real-world applications and researchers who wish to pursue work in this area.

Nearly all state-of-the-art language models and pre-trained language models are based on the Transformer architecture. However, it distinguishes sequential tokens only with the token position index. We hypothesize that better contextual representations can be generated from the Transformer with richer positional information. To verify this, we propose a segment-aware Transformer (Segatron), by replacing the original token position encoding with a combined position encoding of paragraph, sentence, and token. We first introduce the segment-aware mechanism to Transformer-XL, which is a popular Transformer-based language model with memory extension and relative position encoding. We find that our method can further improve the Transformer-XL base model and large model, achieving 17.1 perplexity on the WikiText-103 dataset. We further investigate the pre-training masked language modeling task with Segatron. Experimental results show that BERT pre-trained with Segatron (SegaBERT) can outperform BERT with vanilla Transformer on various NLP tasks, and outperforms RoBERTa on zero-shot sentence representation learning.

These pipelines consist of an efficient first-stage ranking method, like BM25, followed by a neural reranking method. Deviations from this setup often require hacks; some improvements, like adding a second reranking step that uses a more expensive neural method, are infeasible without major code changes. In order to improve the flexibility of such toolkits, we propose implementing experimental pipelines as dependency graphs of functional ""IR primitives,'' which we call modules, that can be used and combined as needed. For example, a neural IR pipeline may rerank results from a Searcher module that efficiently retrieves results from an Index module that it depends on. In turn, the Index depends on a Collection to index, which is provided by the pipeline. This Searcher module is self-contained: the pipeline does not need to know about or interact with the Index of the Searcher, which is transparently shared among Searcher modules when possible (e.g., a BM25 and a QL Searcher might share the same Index). Similarly, a Reranker module might depend on a Trainer (e.g., Tensorflow), feature Extractor, Tokenizer, etc. In both cases, the pipeline needs to interact only with the Reranker or Searcher directly; the complexity of their dependencies is hidden and intelligently managed.

The authors provide a candid assessment of what approaches worked and which ones did not.,A series of best practices are provided, including factors for assessing whether an event can be run online; the mixture of synchronous versus asynchronous content; and important technical questions around delivery. Focusing on a detailed case study of the shift of the physical team-building exercise, the authors note how cloud-based platforms were able to successfully assemble teams and jumpstart online collaboration. The existing decision to use cloud-based infrastructure facilitated the event’s transition as well. The authors use these examples to provide some broader insights on meaningful content delivery during the COVID-19 pandemic.,Moving an event online during a novel pandemic is part of a broader shift within the digital libraries’ community.

To address this problem, we present an effective multi-stage pipeline for passage ranking in conversational search that integrates a widely-used IR system with a conversational query reformulation module. Along these lines, we propose two simple yet effective query reformulation approaches: historical query expansion (HQE) and neural transfer reformulation (NTR). Whereas HQE applies query expansion, a traditional IR query reformulation technique, NTR transfers human knowledge of conversational query understanding to a neural query reformulation model. The proposed HQE method was the top-performing submission of automatic systems in CAsT Track at TREC 2019. Building on this, our NTR approach improves an additional 18% over that best entry in terms of NDCG@3.

To remedy this issue, we propose to learn a categorical variational autoencoder (VAE) based on off-the-shelf pre-trained language models. We theoretically prove that measuring the distance between the latent categorical mixtures, namely Latte-Mix, can better reflect the true sentence semantic similarity. In addition, our Bayesian framework provides explanations for why models finetuned on labelled sentence pairs have better zero-shot performance. We also empirically demonstrate that these finetuned models could be further improved by Latte-Mix.

We show how a sequence-to-sequence model can be trained to generate relevance labels as “target tokens”, and how the underlying logits of these target tokens can be interpreted as relevance probabilities for ranking. Experimental results on the MS MARCO passage ranking task show that our ranking approach is superior to strong encoder-only models. On three other document retrieval test collections, we demonstrate a zero-shot transfer-based approach that outperforms previous state-of-the-art models requiring in-domain cross-validation. Furthermore, we find that our approach significantly outperforms an encoder-only architecture in a data-poor setting. We investigate this observation in more detail by varying target tokens to probe the model’s use of latent knowledge.

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems are responsible for transcribing these voice queries into text to feed downstream natural language understanding modules. However, ASR is far from perfect, often producing incorrect transcriptions and forcing users to take corrective action. To better understand their impact on sessions, this paper characterizes speech recognition errors as well as subsequent user responses. We provide both quantitative and qualitative analyses, examining the acoustic as well as lexical attributes of the utterances.

We vary the number of final layers that are fine-tuned, then study the resulting change in task-specific effectiveness.

On the other hand, many NLP problems, such as question answering and paraphrase identification, can be considered variants of semantic matching, which is to measure the semantic distance between two pieces of short texts. While at a high level both relevance and semantic matching require modeling textual similarity, many existing techniques for one cannot be easily adapted to the other. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel model, HCAN (Hybrid Co-Attention Network), that comprises (1) a hybrid encoder module that includes ConvNet-based and LSTM-based encoders, (2) a relevance matching module that measures soft term matches with importance weighting at multiple granularities, and (3) a semantic matching module with co-attention mechanisms that capture context-aware semantic relatedness. Evaluations on multiple IR and NLP benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art effectiveness compared to approaches that do not exploit pretraining on external data. Extensive ablation studies suggest that relevance and semantic matching signals are complementary across many problem settings, regardless of the choice of underlying encoders.",Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing,2019.0,43,48,"[{'authorId': '30586030', 'name': 'J.

The recent poster child of this trend is the deep language representation model, which includes BERT, ELMo, and GPT.

In this paper, however, we demonstrate that rudimentary, lightweight neural networks can still be made competitive without architecture changes, external training data, or additional input features. We propose to distill knowledge from BERT, a state-of-the-art language representation model, into a single-layer BiLSTM, as well as its siamese counterpart for sentence-pair tasks.

While there has been work to analyze their behavior in carrying low-level information such as linguistic properties, how they directly contribute to label prediction remains unclear. We find inspiration from biologists and study the affinity between individual neurons and labels, propose a novel metric to quantify the sensitivity of neurons to each label, and conduct experiments to show the validity of our proposed metric. We discover that some neurons are trained to specialize on a subset of labels, and while dropping an arbitrary neuron has little effect on the overall accuracy of the model, dropping label-specialized neurons predictably and significantly degrades prediction accuracy on the associated label. We further examine the consistency of neuron-label affinity across different models.

Furthermore, the growing complexity of modern software ecosystems and the resource constraints most academic research groups operate under make maintaining open-source systems a constant struggle.

Such queries range from specific program navigation (i.e., watch a movie) to requests with vague intents and even queries that have nothing to do with watching TV. We present successively richer neural network architectures to tackle this challenge based on two key insights: The first is that session context can be exploited to disambiguate queries and recover from ASR errors, which we operationalize with hierarchical recurrent neural networks. The second insight is that query understanding requires evidence integration across multiple related tasks, which we identify as program prediction, intent classification, and query tagging. We present a novel multi-task neural architecture that jointly learns to accomplish all three tasks. Our initial model, already deployed in production, serves millions of queries daily with an improved customer experience. The novel multi-task learning model, first described here, is evaluated through carefully-controlled laboratory experiments, which demonstrates further gains in effectiveness and increased system capabilities.",Knowledge Discovery and Data Mining,2018.0,38,20,"[{'authorId': '30586030', 'name': 'J.

There is substantial interest in the class of natural language questions that can be answered via the lookup of a single fact, driven by the availability of the popular SimpleQuestions dataset. The problem with this dataset, however, is that answer triples are provided from Freebase, which has been defunct for several years. As a result, it is difficult to build “real-world” question answering systems that are operationally deployable. Furthermore, a defunct knowledge graph means that much of the infrastructure for querying, browsing, and manipulating triples no longer exists. To address this problem, we present SimpleDBpediaQA, a new benchmark dataset for simple question answering over knowledge graphs that was created by mapping SimpleQuestions entities and predicates from Freebase to DBpedia. Although this mapping is conceptually straightforward, there are a number of nuances that make the task non-trivial, owing to the different conceptual organizations of the two knowledge graphs.

Historically, content analysis of Tweets has not been a priority, and instead engineering efforts have focused on graph-based recommendation techniques that exploit structural properties of the follow graph and engagement signals from users. These represent ""low hanging fruits"" that have enabled high-quality recommendations using simple algorithms. As deployed systems have grown in maturity and our understanding of the problem space has become more refined, we have begun to look for other opportunities to further improve recommendation quality.

However, the interaction between multi-threaded indexing and score ties during retrieval may yield non-deterministic rankings, making repeatability not as trivial as one might imagine. In the context of the open-source Lucene search engine, score ties are broken by internal document ids, which are assigned at index time. Due to multi-threaded indexing, which makes experimentation with large modern document collections practical, internal document ids are not assigned consistently between different index instances of the same collection, and thus score ties are broken unpredictably. This short paper examines the effectiveness impact of such score ties, quantifying the variability that can be attributed to this phenomenon. The obvious solution to this non-determinism and to ensure repeatable document ranking is to break score ties using external collection document ids. This approach, however, comes with measurable efficiency costs due to the necessity of consulting external identifiers during query evaluation.",Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2018.0,13,17,"[{'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

Several research domains such as information retrieval have long relied on systematic evaluation to measure progress: here, the Cranfield paradigm of creating shared test collections, defining search tasks, and collecting ground truth for these tasks has persisted up until now. In recent years, however, several new challenges have emerged that do not fit this paradigm very well: extremely large data sets, confidential data sets as found in the medical domain, and rapidly changing data sets as often encountered in industry. Crowdsourcing has also changed the way in which industry approaches problem-solving with companies now organizing challenges and handing out monetary awards to incentivize people to work on their challenges, particularly in the field of machine learning. This article is based on discussions at a workshop on Evaluation-as-a-Service (EaaS). EaaS is the paradigm of not providing data sets to participants and have them work on the data locally, but keeping the data central and allowing access via Application Programming Interfaces (API), Virtual Machines (VM), or other possibilities to ship executables. The objectives of this article are to summarize and compare the current approaches and consolidate the experiences of these approaches to outline the next steps of EaaS, particularly toward sustainable research infrastructures. The article summarizes several existing approaches to EaaS and analyzes their usage scenarios and also the advantages and disadvantages. The many factors influencing EaaS are summarized, and the environment in terms of motivations for the various stakeholders, from funding agencies to challenge organizers, researchers and participants, to industry interested in supplying real-world problems for which they require solutions. EaaS solves many problems of the current research environment, where data sets are often not accessible to many researchers. Executables of published tools are equally often not available making the reproducibility of results impossible. EaaS, however, creates reusable/citable data sets as well as available executables.

WALK was an interdisciplinary project spearheaded by scholars at York University, the University of Waterloo, and the University of Alberta. The project's goal was to bring together major Canadian web archive holdings and provide researcher access to search indexes and derivative files, including plain text, network diagrams, and domain frequency information. These will be useful to digital humanists who want to work with text at scale or the hyperlink networks of large parts of the archived Web. 
 
Six universities participated: the University of Toronto, University of Alberta, University of Victoria, University of Winnipeg, Dalhousie University, and Simon Fraser University. These files reflect the state of their public web archives in late-2017 to mid-2018. 
 
Each xz file contains: derivative files for a given collection, a GraphML file which you can load with Gephi (it will not have any basic layouts or transformations done to it, requiring you to do so manually), a csv file that explains the distribution of domains within the web archive, and a txt file that contains the plain text extracted from HTML documents within the web archive. You can find the crawl date, full URL, and the plain text of each page within the txt file. It may also contain a GEXF file which you can load with Gephi. It will have a basic layout courtesy of our GraphPass program, allowing you to see major nodes and communities in the network.

In this paper, we propose a unified framework for predicting a range of performance-sensitive parameters based on minimizing end-to-end effectiveness loss. The framework does not require relevance judgments for training, is amenable to predicting a wide range of parameters, allows for fine tuned efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs, and can be easily deployed in large scale search systems with minimal overhead. As a proof of concept, we show that the framework can accurately predict a number of performance parameters on a query-by-query basis, allowing efficient and effective retrieval, while simultaneously minimizing the tail latency of an early-stage candidate generation system. On the 50 million document ClueWeb09B collection, and across 25,000 queries, our hybrid system can achieve superior early-stage efficiency to fixed parameter systems without loss of effectiveness, and allows more finely-grained efficiency-effectiveness trade-offs across the multiple stages of the retrieval system.",Web Search and Data Mining,2017.0,69,47,"[{'authorId': '47470313', 'name': 'J.

In a process similar to pseudo-relevance feedback, the distribution of document timestamps from the results of an initial query can be leveraged to infer the distribution of relevant documents, for example, using kernel density estimation. In this paper, we explore an alternative approach to mining relevance signals directly from the temporal statistics of query terms in the collection, without the need to perform an initial retrieval. We propose two approaches: a linear ranking model that combines features derived from temporal collection statistics of query terms and a regression-based method that attempts to directly predict the distribution of relevant documents from query term statistics.

Our starting point is that users derive either positive utility (i.e., ""gain"") or negative utility (i.e., ""pain"") from consuming system updates. By separately keeping track of these quantities, we can measure system effectiveness in a gain vs. pain tradeoff space. The Pareto Frontier of evaluated systems represents the state of the art: for each system on the frontier, no other system can offer more gain without more pain. Our framework has several advantages: it unifies three previous TREC evaluations, subsumes existing metrics, and provides more insightful analyses.

Although important, answer selection is only one stage in a standard end-to-end question answering pipeline. This paper explores the effectiveness of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for answer selection in an end-to-end context using the standard TrecQA dataset. We observe that a simple idf-weighted word overlap algorithm forms a very strong baseline, and that despite substantial efforts by the community in applying deep learning to tackle answer selection, the gains are modest at best on this dataset. Furthermore, it is unclear if a CNN is more effective than the baseline in an end-to-end context based on standard retrieval metrics. To further explore this finding, we conducted a manual user evaluation, which confirms that answers from the CNN are detectably better than those from idf-weighted word overlap. This result suggests that users are sensitive to relatively small differences in answer selection quality.",arXiv.org,2017.0,30,21,"[{'authorId': '2249980', 'name': 'R.

This paper focuses on the problem of answer selection for question answering: we attempt to replicate the results of Severyn and Moschitti using their open-source code as well as to reproduce their results via a de novo (i.e., from scratch) implementation using a completely different deep learning toolkit. Our de novo implementation is instructive in ascertaining whether reported results generalize across toolkits, each of which have their idiosyncrasies. We were able to successfully replicate and reproduce the reported results of Severyn and Moschitti, albeit with minor differences in effectiveness, but affirming the overall design of their model. Additional ablation experiments break down the components of the model to show their contributions to overall effectiveness.

Our work controls for score quantization, document processing, compression, implementation language, implementation effort, and a number of details, arriving at an empirical evaluation that fairly characterizes the performance of three specific techniques: WAND (DaaT), BMW (DaaT), and JASS (SaaT). Experiments reveal a number of interesting findings. The performance gap between WAND and BMW is not as clear as the literature suggests, and both methods are susceptible to tail queries that may take orders of magnitude longer than the median query to execute. Surprisingly, approximate query evaluation in WAND and BMW does not significantly reduce the risk of these tail queries. Overall, JASS is slightly slower than either WAND or BMW, but exhibits much lower variance in query latencies and is much less susceptible to tail query effects. Furthermore, JASS query latency is not particularly sensitive to the retrieval depth, making it an appealing solution for performance-sensitive applications where bounds on query latencies are desirable.",Web Search and Data Mining,2017.0,41,52,"[{'authorId': '48221273', 'name': 'Matt Crane'}, {'authorId': '144159418', 'name': 'J.

On the other hand, Lucene has become the de facto platform in industry for building search applications (outside a small number of companies that deploy custom infrastructure). Compared to academic IR toolkits, Lucene can handle heterogeneous web collections at scale, but lacks systematic support for evaluation over standard test collections. This paper introduces Anserini, a new information retrieval toolkit that aims to provide the best of both worlds, to better align information retrieval practice and research. Anserini provides wrappers and extensions on top of core Lucene libraries that allow researchers to use more intuitive APIs to accomplish common research tasks. Our initial efforts have focused on three functionalities: scalable, multi-threaded inverted indexing to handle modern web-scale collections, streamlined IR evaluation for ad hoc retrieval on standard test collections, and an extensible architecture for multi-stage ranking. Anserini ships with support for many TREC test collections, providing a convenient way to replicate competitive baselines right out of the box.

One obvious integration strategy is to expose the neural network directly as a service. For this, we use Apache Thrift, a software framework for building scalable cross-language services. In exploring alternative architectures, we observe that once trained, the feedforward evaluation of neural networks is quite straightforward. Therefore, we can extract the parameters of a trained CNN from PyTorch and import the model into Java, taking advantage of the Java Deeplearning4J library for feedforward evaluation. This has the advantage that the entire end-to-end system can be implemented in Java. As a third approach, we can extract the neural network from PyTorch and ""compile"" it into a C++ program that exposes a Thrift service.

In other cases, evaluation organizers have set up APIs that provide access to collections for specific tasks, without exposing the underlying content.

This is a difficult problem for several reasons: such queries are short, even shorter than comparable voice queries in other domains, which offers fewer opportunities for deciphering user intent. Furthermore, ambiguity is exacerbated by underlying speech recognition errors. We address these challenges by integrating word- and character-level query representations and by modeling voice search sessions to capture the contextual dependencies in query sequences. Both are accomplished with a probabilistic framework in which recurrent and feedforward neural network modules are organized in a hierarchical manner. From a raw dataset of 32M voice queries from 2.5M viewers on the Comcast Xfinity X1 entertainment system, we extracted data to train and test our models. We demonstrate the benefits of our hybrid representation and context-aware model, which significantly outperforms competitive baselines that use learning to rank as well as neural networks.",International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2017.0,49,17,"[{'authorId': '30586030', 'name': 'J.

Starting with a collection of question-answer pairs from the popular TrecQA dataset, we identify the original documents from which the answers were drawn. Sentences from these source documents that contain query terms (aside from the answers) are selected as negative examples. Training on the original data plus these negative examples yields improvements in effectiveness by a margin that is comparable to successive recent publications on this dataset. Our technique is completely unsupervised, which means that the gains come essentially for free. We confirm that the improvements can be directly attributed to our heuristic, as other approaches to extracting comparable amounts of training data are not effective.

Previous work on web collections has shown that it is possible to retain high-quality results while considering only a small fraction of the collection. These studies, however, assume static collections where it is feasible to run batch clustering algorithms for partitioning. In this work, we consider the novel formulation of selective search on document streams (specifically, tweets), where partitioning must be performed incrementally. In our approach, documents are partitioned into temporal segments and selective search is performed within each segment: these segments can either be clustered using batch or online algorithms, and at different temporal granularities. For efficiency, we take advantage of word embeddings to reduce the dimensionality of the document vectors. Experiments with test collections from the TREC Microblog Tracks show that we are able to achieve precision indistinguishable from exhaustive search while considering only around 5% of the collection. Interestingly, we observe no significant effectiveness differences between batch vs. online clustering and between hourly vs. daily temporal segments, despite them being very different index organizations. This suggests that architectural choices should be primarily guided by efficiency considerations.",Web Search and Data Mining,2017.0,50,1,"[{'authorId': '2115663562', 'name': 'Yulu Wang'}, {'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

We propose a simple yet effective technique for determining this ""switchover"" point, which intuitively can be understood as the ""knee"" in an effort vs. recall gain curve, as well as alternative sampling strategies beyond the knee.

In the first, the user desires relevant and non-redundant documents that capture important aspects of an information need. In the second, the user wishes to receive timely, relevant, and non-redundant update notifications for a standing information need. Despite superficial similarities, interleaved evaluation methods for web ranking cannot be directly applied to these tasks; for example, existing techniques do not account for temporality or redundancy. Our proposed evaluation methodology consists of two components: a temporal interleaving strategy and a heuristic for credit assignment to handle redundancy. By simulating user interactions with interleaved results on submitted runs to the TREC 2014 tweet timeline generation (TTG) task and the TREC 2015 real-time filtering task, we demonstrate that our methodology yields system comparisons that accurately match the result of batch evaluations.

We begin with an analysis of metrics deployed at the TREC 2015 Microblog evaluations. A simple change to the metrics, reflecting a different assumption, dramatically alters system rankings. Applying another metric, previously used in the TREC Microblog evaluations, again yields different system rankings. We find little correlation between a number of ""reasonable"" evaluation metrics, which suggests that system effectiveness depends on how you measure it---an undesirable state in IR evaluation. However, we argue that existing evaluation metrics can be generalized into a framework that uses the same underlying contingency table, but places different weights and penalties.

One concern with this evaluation approach is that the API introduces biases and limits the diversity of techniques that can be brought to bear on the problem. In this paper, we tackle the question of API bias using the concept of retrievability. The raw data for our analyses come from a naturally-occurring experiment where we observed the same groups completing the same task with the API and also with access to the raw collection. We find that the retrievability bias of runs generated in both cases are comparable. Moreover, the fraction of relevant tweets retrieved through the API by the participating groups is at least as high as when they had access to the raw collection.",International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval,2016.0,8,7,"[{'authorId': '2071527', 'name': 'Jiaul H.

For example, the Linked Open Data (LOD) cloud now consists of thousands of RDF data sets with over 30 billion triples, and the number and size of the data sets is continuously growing. Many of the data sets in the LOD cloud provide public SPARQL endpoints to allow issuing queries over them. These end-points enable users to retrieve data using precise and highly expressive SPARQL queries. However, in order to do so, the user must have sufficient knowledge about the data sets that she wishes to query, that is, the structure of data, the vocabulary used within the data set, the exact values of literals, their data types, etc. Thus, while SPARQL is powerful, it is not easy to use. An alternative to SPARQL that does not require as much prior knowledge of the data is some form of keyword search over the structured data. Keyword search queries are easy to use, but inherently ambiguous in describing structured queries. 
 
This demonstration introduces Sapphire, a system for querying RDF data that strikes a middle ground between ambiguous keyword search and difficult-to-use SPARQL. Our system does not replace either, but utilizes both where they are most effective. Sapphire helps the user construct expressive SPARQL queries that represent her information needs without requiring detailed knowledge about the queried data sets. These queries are then executed over public SPARQL endpoints from the LOD cloud. Sapphire guides the user in the query writing process by showing suggestions of query terms based on the queried data, and by recommending changes to the query based on a predictive user model.",Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016.0,44,14,"[{'authorId': '90981528', 'name': 'Ahmed El-Roby'}, {'authorId': '2073283133', 'name': 'Khalid Ammar'}, {'authorId': '1704622', 'name': 'Ashraf Aboulnaga'}, {'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

In such an architecture, the quality of the final ranked list may not be sensitive to the quality of initial candidate pool, especially in terms of early precision. This provides several opportunities to increase retrieval efficiency without significantly sacrificing effectiveness. In this paper, we explore a new approach to dynamically predicting two different parameters in the candidate generation stage which can directly affect the overall efficiency and effectiveness of the entire system. Previous work exploring this tradeoff has focused on global parameter settings that apply to all queries, even though optimal settings vary across queries. In contrast, we propose a technique which makes a parameter prediction that maximizes efficiency within a effectiveness envelope on a per query basis, using only static pre-retrieval features. The query-specific tradeoff point between effectiveness and efficiency is decided using a classifier cascade that weighs possible efficiency gains against effectiveness losses over a range of possible parameter cutoffs to make the prediction. The interesting twist in our new approach is to train classifiers without requiring explicit relevance judgments. We show that our framework is generalizable by applying it to two different retrieval parameters - selecting k in common top-k query retrieval algorithms, and setting a quality threshold, $\rho$, for score-at-a-time approximate query evaluation algorithms. Experimental results show that substantial efficiency gains are achievable depending on the dynamic parameter choice. In addition, our framework provides a versatile tool that can be used to estimate the effectiveness-efficiency tradeoffs that are possible before selecting and tuning algorithms to make machine learned predictions.",arXiv.org,2016.0,40,1,"[{'authorId': '144159418', 'name': 'J.

As motivation, we trace the evolution of our formulation and approach to the graph recommendation problem, embodied in successive generations of systems. Two trends can be identified: supplementing batch with real-time processing and a broadening of the scope of recommendations from users to content. Both of these trends come together in Graph-Jet, an in-memory graph processing engine that maintains a real-time bipartite interaction graph between users and tweets. The storage engine implements a simple API, but one that is sufficiently expressive to support a range of recommendation algorithms based on random walks that we have refined over the years. Similar to Cassovary, a previous graph recommendation engine developed at Twitter, GraphJet assumes that the entire graph can be held in memory on a single server. The system organizes the interaction graph into temporally-partitioned index segments that hold adjacency lists. GraphJet is able to support rapid ingestion of edges while concurrently serving lookup queries through a combination of compact edge encoding and a dynamic memory allocation scheme that exploits power-law characteristics of the graph. Each GraphJet server ingests up to one million graph edges per second, and in steady state, computes up to 500 recommendations per second, which translates into several million edge read operations per second.",Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2016.0,45,65,"[{'authorId': '2109669217', 'name': 'Aneesh Sharma'}, {'authorId': '2116635559', 'name': 'Jerry Jiang'}, {'authorId': '3083186', 'name': 'Praveen Bommannavar'}, {'authorId': '2054132231', 'name': 'B.

In this paper we propose a new strategy, which we call rank-at-a-time query processing, that evaluates documents in descending order of quantized scores and is able to directly compute the final document ranking via a sequence of boolean intersections. We show that such a strategy is equivalent to a second-order restricted composition of per-term scores. Rank-at-a-time query processing has the advantage that it is anytime score-safe, which means that the retrieval algorithm can self-adapt to produce an exact ranking given an arbitrary latency constraint. Due to the combinatorial nature of compositions, however, a naive implementation is too slow to be of practical use. To address this issue, we introduce a hybrid variant that is able to reduce query latency to a point that is on par with state-of-the-art retrieval engines.",International Conference on the Theory of Information Retrieval,2016.0,17,1,"[{'authorId': '1911619', 'name': 'Ahmed Elbagoury'}, {'authorId': '48221273', 'name': 'Matt Crane'}, {'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

We describe the implementation of a workbench created for, and evaluated by, image catalogers. We discuss the current functionality and future goals for this image catalogers’ toolkit, developed under the Computational Linguistics for Metadata Building (CLiMB) research project.1 Our primary user group for initial phases of the project is the cataloger expert; in future work we address applications for end users. 1 The Problem: Insufficient Subject Access to Images The CLiMB project addresses the existing gap in subject description in metadata for image collections, particularly for the domains of art history, architecture and landscape architecture. Within each of these domains, image collections are increasingly available online yet the availability of subject-oriented access points for these images remains minimal, at best. In an initial observational study conducted with six image catalogers, we found that typically between one and eight subject terms are added to catalog records for images and many legacy records lack subject entries altogether. The literature on end users’ image searching practices indicates that this level of subject description may be insufficient for some user groups. In a study of the imagesearching behaviors of faculty and graduate students in the domain of American history [3], found that 92% of the thirty-eight participants considered the textual information associated with the images inadequate for the images searched in the Library of Congress’ American Memory Collection. The individual records in this collection typically contain quantities of subject descriptors comparable to—or exceedingthose found in the exploratory CLiMB studies.

This is formally captured by a continuous hidden Markov model (cHMM), for which we derive an EM algorithm for parameter estimation. Given a query, we estimate the parameters for a cHMM that best explains the observed distribution of an initial set of retrieved documents, and then use Viterbi decoding to compute the most likely state sequence. In identifying expansion terms, we only select documents from bursty states.

The quality of the research is judged based on the magnitude of the improvement and whether the methodological choices suggest external validity and generalizability, for example, whether the experimental setup is “realistic” or whether the baseline methods reflect the state of the art. Unfortunately, research demonstrating the failure to reproduce or generalize previous results does not have a similar publication venue. This sort of result—often referred to as a ‘negative result’—serves to control the quality of published research in a scientific discipline and to better understand the limits of previously published methods. Publication venues for such research exist in fields such as ecology, biomedicine, pharmacy,, and social science. The SIGIR 2015 Workshop on Reproducibility, Inexplicability, and Generalizability of Results (RIGOR) aims to provide a venue for publication and discussion of IR research that fails to reproduce a previously published result under the same or similar experimental conditions (e.g., same test collection and system configuration) and research that demonstrates the failure to generalize an existing approach to a new domain.

Despite the tremendous enthusiasm for big data, there is no shortage of detractors. This article argues that many criticisms stem from a fundamental confusion over goals: whether the desired outcome of big data use is “better science” or “better engineering.” Critics point to the rejection of traditional data collection and analysis methods, confusion between correlation and causation, and an indifference to models with explanatory power. From the perspective of advancing social science, these are valid reservations. I contend, however, that if the end goal of big data use is to engineer computational artifacts that are more effective according to well-defined metrics, then whatever improves those metrics should be exploited without prejudice. Sound scientific reasoning, while helpful, is not necessary to improve engineering. Understanding the distinction between science and engineering resolves many of the apparent controversies surrounding big data and helps to clarify the criteria by which contributions should be assessed.",,2015.0,28,26,"[{'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

First, are the differences statistically significant? Second, is the comparison stable with respect to assessor differences? Finally, is the difference actually meaningful to a user? This paper tackles the last two questions about assessor differences and user preferences in the context of the newly-introduced tweet timeline generation task in the TREC 2014 Microblog track, where the system's goal is to construct an informative summary of non-redundant tweets that addresses the user's information need. Central to the evaluation methodology is human-generated semantic clusters of tweets that contain substantively similar information. We show that the evaluation is stable with respect to assessor differences in clustering and that user preferences generally correlate with effectiveness metrics even though users are not explicitly aware of the semantic clustering being performed by the systems. Although our analyses are limited to this particular task, we believe that lessons learned could generalize to other evaluations based on establishing semantic equivalence between information units, such as nugget-based evaluations in question answering and temporal summarization.",Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2015.0,36,29,"[{'authorId': '2115663562', 'name': 'Yulu Wang'}, {'authorId': '17010256', 'name': 'G.

This approach is limited in practical applications by the computational expense of online lookup and extraction. For phrase-based models, recent work has shown that on-demand grammar extraction can be greatly accelerated by parallelization on general purpose graphics processing units (GPUs), but these algorithms do not work for hierarchical models, which require matching patterns that contain gaps. We address this limitation by presenting a novel GPU algorithm for on-demand hierarchical grammar extraction that is at least an order of magnitude faster than a comparable CPU algorithm when processing large batches of sentences. In terms of end-to-end translation, with decoding on the CPU, we increase throughput by roughly two thirds on a standard MT evaluation dataset. The GPU necessary to achieve these improvements increases the cost of a server by about a third.

Today, this assumption needs to be re-evaluated. Although petabyte-scale datastores are increasingly common, it is unclear whether “typical” analytics tasks require more than a single high-end server. Additionally, we are seeing increased sophistication in analytics, e.g., machine learning, where we process smaller and more refined datasets. To address these trends, we propose “scaling down” Hadoop to run on multi-core, shared-memory machines. This paper presents a prototype runtime called Hone (“Hadoop One”) that is API compatible with Hadoop. With Hone, we can take an existing Hadoop application and run it efficiently on a single server.

For rapid prototyping, this is particularly advantageous since researchers can explore new scoring functions and features by simply issuing SQL queries, without needing to write imperative code. We demonstrate the feasibility of this approach by an implementation of conjunctive BM25 using two modern column stores.

We tackle two core issues that are central to query translation: how to exploit context to generate more accurate translations and how to preserve ambiguity that may be present in the original query, thereby retaining a diverse set of translation alternatives. These two considerations are often in tension since ambiguity in natural language is typically resolved by exploiting context, but effective retrieval requires striking the right balance. We propose two novel query translation approaches: the grammar-based approach extracts translation probabilities from translation grammars, while the decoder-based approach takes advantage of n-best translation hypotheses. Both are context-sensitive, in contrast to a baseline context-insensitive approach that uses bilingual dictionaries for word-by-word translation. Experimental results show that by “opening up” modern statistical machine translation systems, we can access intermediate representations that yield high retrieval effectiveness. By combining evidence from multiple sources, we demonstrate significant improvements over competitive baselines on standard cross-language information retrieval test collections. In addition to effectiveness, the efficiency of our techniques are explored as well.",TOIS,2014.0,70,12,"[{'authorId': '2851411', 'name': 'Ferhan Ture'}, {'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

This task, which is useful in localized recommendations and other applications, is challenging since computing the join is super-linear with respect to the size of the collection. In this paper, we explore partitioning strategies for tackling STJoin. One approach is to start with a spatial data structure, traverse regions and apply a previous algorithm for identifying similar pairs of textual documents called All-Pairs. An alternative approach is to construct a global index but partition postings spatially and modify the All-Pairs algorithm to prune candidates based on distance. We evaluate these approaches on two real-world datasets and find that when running in a single thread, both approaches are comparable in terms of performance. However, a multi-threaded implementation of the global index approach is able to achieve far better speedup given its ability to parallelize at a finer granularity to avoid skewed distributions in task sizes. In addition to using All-Pairs as the underlying textual similarity join algorithm, we also explored an alternate algorithm known as PPJ: our findings are consistent, which suggests that load balancing is a fundamental issue affecting parallel implementations of STJoin algorithms.",BigSpatial@SIGSPATIAL,2014.0,35,13,"[{'authorId': '30586030', 'name': 'J.

The basic idea is that evaluation organizers provide a service API through which the evaluation task can be completed. However, this concept violates some of the premises of traditional pool-based collection building and thus calls into question the quality of the resulting test collection. In particular, the service API might restrict the diversity of runs that contribute to the pool: this might hamper innovation by researchers and lead to incomplete judgment pools that affect the reusability of the collection. This paper shows that the distinctiveness of the retrieval runs used to construct the first test collection built using EaaS, the TREC 2013 Microblog collection, is not substantially different from that of the TREC-8 ad hoc collection, a high-quality collection built using traditional pooling. Further analysis using the `leave out uniques' test suggests that pools from the Microblog 2013 collection are less complete than those from TREC-8, although both collections benefit from the presence of distinctive and effective manual runs. Although we cannot yet generalize to all EaaS implementations, our analyses reveal no obvious flaws in the test collection built using the methodology in the TREC 2013 Microblog track.",Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2014.0,11,5,"[{'authorId': '1746656', 'name': 'E.

Examples of such tasks include ego network analysis, motif counting in biological networks, finding social circles, personalized recommendations, link prediction, anomaly detection, analyzing influence cascades, and so on. These tasks are not well served by existing vertex-centric graph processing frameworks whose computation and execution models limit the user program to directly access the state of a single vertex, resulting in high communication, scheduling, and memory overheads in executing such tasks. Further, most existing graph processing frameworks also typically ignore the challenges in extracting the relevant portions of the graph that an analysis task is interested in, and loading it onto distributed memory. 
 
In this demonstration proposal, we describe NScale, a novel end-to-end graph processing framework that enables the distributed execution of complex neighborhood-centric analytics over large-scale graphs in the cloud. NScale enables users to write programs at the level of neighborhoods or subgraphs. NScale uses Apache YARN for efficient and fault-tolerant distribution of data and computation; it features GEL, a novel graph extraction and loading phase, that extracts the relevant portions of the graph and loads them into distributed memory using as few machines as possible. NScale utilizes novel techniques for the distributed execution of user computation that minimize memory consumption by exploiting overlap among the neighborhoods of interest.

In this context, we present a novel incremental inverted indexing algorithm for web-scale collections that directly constructs compressed postings lists in memory. Designing efficient in-memory algorithms requires understanding modern processor architectures: in this paper, we explore the issue of postings list contiguity. Postings lists that occupy contiguous memory regions are preferred for retrieval, but maintaining contiguity is costly in terms of speed and complexity. On the other hand, allowing discontiguous index segments simplifies index construction but decreases retrieval performance. Understanding this tradeoff is our main contribution: We show that co-locating small groups of inverted list segments yields query evaluation performance that is statistically indistinguishable from fully-contiguous postings lists.

Experiments on TREC datasets confirm that our temporal feedback formulation improves search effectiveness, thus providing support for our hypothesis.

For each of these properties, we compare and contrast with available data from other social networks. These analyses provide a set of authoritative statistics that the community can reference. In addition, we use these data to investigate an often-posed question: Is Twitter a social network or an information network? The ""follow"" relationship in Twitter is primarily about information consumption, yet many follows are built on social ties. Not surprisingly, we find that the Twitter follow graph exhibits structural characteristics of both an information network and a social network. Going beyond descriptive characterizations, we hypothesize that from an individual user's perspective, Twitter starts off more like an information network, but evolves to behave more like a social network. We provide preliminary evidence that may serve as a formal model of how a hybrid network like Twitter evolves.",The Web Conference,2014.0,17,331,"[{'authorId': '50362385', 'name': 'Seth A.

Summingbird programs are written using dataflow abstractions such as sources, sinks, and stores, and can run on different execution platforms: Hadoop for batch processing (via Scalding/Cascading) and Storm for online processing. Different execution modes require different bindings for the dataflow abstractions (e.g., HDFS files or message queues for the source) but do not require any changes to the program logic. Furthermore, Summingbird can operate in a hybrid processing mode that transparently integrates batch and online results to efficiently generate up-to-date aggregations over long time spans. The language was designed to improve developer productivity and address pain points in building analytics solutions at Twitter where often, the same code needs to be written twice (once for batch processing and again for online processing) and indefinitely maintained in parallel. Our key insight is that certain algebraic structures provide the theoretical foundation for integrating batch and online processing in a seamless fashion. This means that Summingbird imposes constraints on the types of aggregations that can be performed, although in practice we have not found these constraints to be overly restrictive for a broad range of analytics tasks at Twitter.",Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2014.0,41,115,"[{'authorId': '2285378115', 'name': 'Oscar Boykin'}, {'authorId': '2285377817', 'name': 'Samuel English Ritchie'}, {'authorId': '2085838261', 'name': ""I.

One important lesson is that successful big data mining in practice is about much more than what most academics would consider data mining: life ""in the trenches"" is occupied by much preparatory work that precedes the application of data mining algorithms and followed by substantial effort to turn preliminary models into robust solutions. In this context, we discuss two topics: First, schemas play an important role in helping data scientists understand petabyte-scale data stores, but they're insufficient to provide an overall ""big picture"" of the data available to generate insights. Second, we observe that a major challenge in building data analytics platforms stems from the heterogeneity of the various components that must be integrated together into production workflows---we refer to this as ""plumbing"". This paper has two goals: For practitioners, we hope to share our experiences to flatten bumps in the road for those who come after us.

In this context, we present a novel incremental inverted indexing algorithm for web-scale collections that directly constructs compressed postings lists in memory. Designing efficient in-memory algorithms requires understanding modern processor architectures and memory hierarchies: in this paper, we explore the issue of postings lists contiguity. Naturally, postings lists that occupy contiguous memory regions are preferred for retrieval, but maintaining contiguity increases complexity and slows indexing. On the other hand, allowing discontiguous index segments simplifies index construction but decreases retrieval performance. Understanding this tradeoff is our main contribution: We find that co-locating small groups of inverted list segments yields query evaluation performance that is statistically indistinguishable from fully-contiguous postings lists. In other words, it is not necessary to lay out in-memory data structures such that all postings for a term are contiguous; we can achieve ideal performance with a relatively small amount of effort.",arXiv.org,2013.0,43,4,"[{'authorId': '1858497', 'name': 'N.

In the context of real-time search on tweets, this work explores candidate generation in a two-stage retrieval architecture where an initial list of results is processed by a second-stage rescorer to produce the final output. We introduce Bloom filter chains, a novel extension of Bloom filters that can dynamically expand to efficiently represent an arbitrarily long and growing list of monotonically-increasing integers with a constant false positive rate. Using a collection of Bloom filter chains, a novel approximate candidate generation algorithm called BWand is able to perform both conjunctive and disjunctive retrieval. Experiments show that our algorithm is many times faster than competitive baselines and that this increased performance does not require sacrificing end-to-end effectiveness.

For example, based on external knowledge, a searcher might prefer more recent results or results within a particular time interval. However, most search applications do not allow the user to explicitly supply this information, and neither do most retrieval models have a mechanism to incorporate this additional evidence. In this paper, we introduce the notion of a temporal relevance profile, which a user explicitly includes alongside a keyword search query. We propose alternative representations of temporal relevance profiles and how existing retrieval models might take advantage of this data.

The core issue can be characterized as a ""Goldilocks Problem"". Because memory remains today a scare resource, an allocation policy that is too aggressive leads to inefficient utilization, while a policy that is too conservative is slow and leads to fragmented postings lists. We present a dynamic postings allocation policy that allocates memory in increasingly-larger ""slices"" from a small number of large, fixed pools of memory.

Additionally, we are seeing increased sophistication in analytics, e.g., machine learning, which generally operates over smaller and more refined datasets. To address these trends, we propose ""scaling down"" Hadoop to run on shared-memory machines. This paper presents a prototype runtime called Hone, intended to be both API and binary compatible with standard (distributed) Hadoop. That is, Hone can take an existing Hadoop jar and efficiently execute it, without modification, on a multi-core shared memory machine. This allows us to take existing Hadoop algorithms and find the most suitable run-time environment for execution on datasets of varying sizes. Our experiments show that Hone can be an order of magnitude faster than Hadoop pseudo-distributed mode (PDM); on dataset sizes that fit into memory, Hone can outperform a fully-distributed 15-node Hadoop cluster in some cases as well.",Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment,2013.0,12,18,"[{'authorId': '144080313', 'name': 'K.

However, for certain tasks, such as evaluating the effectiveness of a new retrieval technique or estimating the parameters of a learning to rank model, a corpus alone is not enough. For these tasks, queries and relevance judgments associated with the corpus are also necessary. However, researchers often find themselves in scenarios where they only have access to a corpus, in which case evaluation and learning to rank become challenging. Document corpora are relatively straightforward to gather. On the other hand, obtaining queries and relevance judgments for a given corpus is costly. In production environments, it may be possible to obtain low-cost relevance information using query and click logs. However, in more constrained research environments these options are not available, and relevance judgments are usually provided by humans. To reduce the cost of this potentially expensive process, researchers have developed low-cost evaluation strategies, including minimal test collections [2] and crowdsourcing [1]. Despite the usefulness of these strategies, the resulting relevance judgments cannot easily be “ported” to a new or different corpus. To overcome these issues, we propose a new method to reduce manual annotation costs by transferring relevance judgments across corpora. Assuming that a set of queries and relevance judgments have been manually constructed for a source document corpus Ds, our goal is to automatically construct a test collection for a target document corpus Dt by projecting the existing test collection from Ds onto Dt. The goal of projecting test collections is not to produce manual quality test collections. In fact, it is assumed that projected test collections will contain noisy relevance judgments (i.e., ones which humans are unlikely to agree with). The important question, however, is whether these noisy projected judgments are useful for training ranking models in the target corpus.",Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2011.0,3,0,"[{'authorId': '1858497', 'name': 'N.

This paper examines the feasibility of constructing web search test collections in a completely unsupervised manner given only a large web corpus as input. Within our proposed framework, anchor text extracted from the web graph is treated as a pseudo query log from which pseudo queries are sampled. For each pseudo query, a set of relevant and non-relevant documents are selected using a variety of web-specific features, including spam and aggregated anchor text weights. The automatically mined queries and judgments form a pseudo test collection that can be used for training ranking functions.

Given the explosion of unstructured data begotten by social media and other web-based applications, we take the position that any modern analytics platform must support operations on free-text fields as first-class citizens. Toward this end, this paper addresses one inefficient aspect of Hadoop-based processing: the need to perform a full scan of the entire dataset, even in cases where it is clearly not necessary to do so. We show that it is possible to leverage a full-text index to optimize selection operations on text fields within records. The idea is simple and intuitive: the full-text index informs the Hadoop execution engine which compressed data blocks contain query terms of interest, and only those data blocks are decompressed and scanned. Experiments with a proof of concept show moderate improvements in end-to-end query running times and substantial savings in terms of cumulative processing time at the worker nodes. We present an analytical model and discuss a number of interesting challenges: some operational, others research in nature.",MapReduce '11,2011.0,23,50,"[{'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

This support can be useful when the background provided by an article is insufficient, if other news coverage exists from which an event's history can be extracted. For extended sequences of related events, it is reasonable to expect that articles published after the sequence concludes include less background coverage of the sequence. Focusing on two stereotypical types of event sequences --- kidnappings and corporate acquisitions -- we distinguish between articles providing in-depth coverage, those having multiple sentences mentioning the same event sequence, from articles making a passing mention in just one sentence. We find that, after an event sequence concludes, passing mentions become more common and there are significantly fewer mean mentions per article.",iConference,2011.0,5,0,"[{'authorId': '3003604', 'name': 'Earl J.

The task is conceived as a language modeling problem where per-topic models are trained using hashtags in the tweet stream, which serve as proxies for topic labels. Simple perplexity-based classifiers are then applied to filter the tweet stream for topics of interest. Within this framework, we evaluate, both intrinsically and extrinsically, smoothing techniques for integrating ""foreground"" models (to capture recency) and ""background"" models (to combat sparsity), as well as different techniques for retaining history.

Effectiveness tends to derive from sophisticated ranking functions, such as those constructed using learning to rank, while efficiency gains tend to arise from improvements in query evaluation and caching strategies. Given their inherently disjoint nature, it is difficult to jointly optimize effectiveness and efficiency in end-to-end systems. To address this problem, we formulate and develop a novel cascade ranking model, which unlike previous approaches, can simultaneously improve both top k ranked effectiveness and retrieval efficiency. The model constructs a cascade of increasingly complex ranking functions that progressively prunes and refines the set of candidate documents to minimize retrieval latency and maximize result set quality. We present a novel boosting algorithm for learning such cascades to directly optimize the tradeoff between effectiveness and efficiency. Experimental results show that our cascades are faster and return higher quality results than comparable ranking models.",Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2011.0,31,220,"[{'authorId': '2144660311', 'name': 'Lidan Wang'}, {'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

In this paper, we address this gap by sharing the distributed search architecture that underlies Twitter user search, a service for discovering relevant accounts on the popular microblogging service. Our design makes use of the principle that eliminates the distinction between failure and other anticipated service disruptions: as a result, most operational scenarios share exactly the same code path.

Solutions to this problem are of general interest for text mining in the multilingual context and have specific applications in statistical machine translation. Our approach takes advantage of cross-language information retrieval (CLIR) techniques to project feature vectors from one language into another, and then uses locality-sensitive hashing (LSH) to extract similar pairs. We show that effective cross-lingual pairwise similarity requires working with similarity thresholds that are much lower than in typical monolingual applications, making the problem quite challenging. We present a parallel, scalable MapReduce implementation of the sort-based sliding window algorithm, which is compared to a brute-force approach on German and English Wikipedia collections. Our central finding can be summarized as“no free lunch”: there is no single optimal solution.

Many graphs of interest are difficult to analyze because of their large size, often spanning millions of vertices and billions of edges. As such, researchers have increasingly turned to distributed solutions. In particular, MapReduce has emerged as an enabling technology for large-scale graph processing. However, existing best practices for MapReduce graph algorithms have significant shortcomings that limit performance, especially with respect to partitioning, serializing, and distributing the graph. In this paper, we present three design patterns that address these issues and can be used to accelerate a large class of graph algorithms based on message passing, exemplified by PageRank.

It is intuitive that the population size of a GA may greatly affect the quality of the solution, but it is unclear what are the effects of having population sizes that are significantly greater than typical experiments. The emergence of MapReduce, a framework running on a cluster of computers that aims to provide large-scale data processing, offers great opportunities to investigate this issue. In this paper, a GA is implemented to scale the population using MapReduce. Experiments are conducted on a large cluster, and population sizes up to 10^7 are inspected. It is shown that larger population sizes not only tend to yield better solutions, but also require fewer generations. Therefore, it is clear that when dealing with a hard problem such as JSSP, an existing GA can be improved by massively scaling up populations with MapReduce, so that the solution can be parallelized and completed in reasonable time.",2010 IEEE Second International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science,2010.0,26,50,"[{'authorId': '2741672', 'name': 'Di-Wei Huang'}, {'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

This paper explores how aspects of this workflow might change in a MapReduce cluster-based environment. First, we present and evaluate two algorithms for inverted indexing that take advantage of the programming model’s sorting mechanism to different extents. The running times of both algorithms scale linearly in terms of collection size up to 102 million web pages. Second, we show that it is possible to efficiently perform batch query evaluation with MapReduce by scanning all postings lists in parallel, as opposed to sequentially accessing each postings list. Third, we explore an approach that forgoes inverted indexing altogether and simply computes all query–document scores from document vectors themselves. Experimental results challenge us to think differently about previous assumptions in information retrieval, and show that brute force approaches are surprisingly compelling under certain circumstances: parallel scan of postings can effectively take advantage of large clusters and parallel scan of documents fits naturally with ranking functions that use document-level features.",,2010.0,37,8,"[{'authorId': '143928505', 'name': 'T.

Naturally, more time should translate into better results, but the ranking algorithm should always produce some results. This property is desirable from a number of perspectives: to cope with diverse users and information needs, as well as to better manage system load and variance in query execution times. We propose two temporally constrained ranking algorithms based on a class of probabilistic prediction models that can naturally incorporate efficiency constraints: one that makes independent feature selection decisions, and the other that makes joint feature selection decisions. Experiments on three different test collections show that both ranking algorithms are able to satisfy imposed time constraints, although the joint model outperforms the independent model in being able to deliver more effective results, especially under tight time constraints, due to its ability to capture feature dependencies.",International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2010.0,27,39,"[{'authorId': '2144660311', 'name': 'Lidan Wang'}, {'authorId': '1680617', 'name': 'Donald Metzler'}, {'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

We hope this conference proves to be interesting and beneficial. 
 
CIKM 2009 was originally planned to be held in Beijing, China. However, due to unforeseen reasons, CIKM 2009 had to be moved to Hong Kong in early December 2009, and the organizing committee was re-invited. This late re-organization of the conference caused many troubles and much burden in terms of preparation and financial costs. Despite the shortened time period and financial problems, David Cheung, the newly invited General co-Chair, and his local team worked very diligently to carefully prepare an outstanding program for everyone. 
 
Since its inception, the CIKM conference has provided a unique international forum for the presentation, discussion, and dissemination of research findings in data management, information retrieval, and knowledge management. The conference has been a leading forum in which experts from academia, industry, and the government gather to exchange ideas, research achievements, and technical developments in multidisciplinary research areas. 
 
CIKM has rapidly grown to become one of the world's most recognized conferences in the field. CIKM 2009 has received a record high number of submissions in the history of CIKM, as can be seen from the following statistics: - 1153 abstracts submitted - 847 full papers submitted - 123 papers accepted for presentation as full papers (14.5% acceptance rate) and an additional 171 were accepted for poster presentation. 
 
In addition to regular research tracks, CIKM 2009 features 3 keynote speakers, 4 pre-conference tutorials, 11 workshops, 18 industrial papers, 24 demo papers, and 1 panel. We are proud of our program and acknowledge the tireless efforts of people who materialized this program. 
 
First of all, we are honored to have 3 distinguished keynote speakers: Kyu-Young Whang, Edward Chang, and Clement Yu. We deeply appreciate their time and commitment to attend our conference and share their cutting-edge research experiences and insightful comments in their research topics.",International Conference on Information and Knowledge Management,2009.0,0,13,"[{'authorId': '1723793', 'name': 'D.

We introduce a pilot project aimed at characterizing adjustments made to biomedical queries that improve search results. Specifically we focus on queries submitted to PubMed®, a large sophisticated search engine that facilitates Web access to abstracts of articles in over 5,200 biomedical journals. On average 2 million users search PubMed each day. During their search, nearly 20% will experience a result page from one of their queries that has zero results. In some cases there really is no document or abstract that will satisfy a particular query. However, in analyzing one month of queries submitted to PubMed, we find that more often than not, queries that retrieved no results are queries that would retrieve something relevant if they were constructed differently. This paper describes a new effort to identify some of the characteristics of a query that produces zero results, and the changes that users most often apply in constructing new, ""corrected"" queries. Zero-result queries afford us an opportunity to examine changes made to queries that we know did not return relevant data, because they did not return any data. An investigation of the changes users make under these circumstances can yield insight into users' search processes.",ACM/IEEE Joint Conference on Digital Libraries,2009.0,0,2,"[{'authorId': '144705242', 'name': 'G.

Within each of these domains, image collections are increasingly available online yet subject access points for these images remain minimal. In an observational study with six image catalogers, we found that typically 1 – 8 subject terms are assigned, and that many legacy records lack subject entries altogether. Studies on end users’ image searching indicate that this level of subject description is often insufficient. In a study of the imagesearching behaviors of faculty and graduate students in American history, Choi and Rasmussen 2003 found that 92% of the 38 participants in their study considered the textual information associated with the images in the Library of Congress’ American Memory Collection to be inadequate. The number of subject descriptors assigned to an image in this collection is comparable to what we found in the exploratory CLiMB studies. Furthermore, these searchers submitted more subject-oriented queries than known-artist and title queries. Similar results demonstrating the importance of subject retrieval have been reported in other studies, including Keister, Collins, and Chen 1994. Under the hypothesis that searchers do not find images they seek partly due to inadequate subject description in metadata fields, the CLiMB project was initiated to address this subject metadata gap by applying automatic and semi-automatic techniques to the identification, extraction, and thesaural linking of subject terms. The CLiMB Toolkit processes text associated with an image through natural language processing (NLP), categorization using machine learning (ML), and disambiguation techniques to identify, filter, and normalize high-quality subject descriptors. Like Pastra et al. 2003 we use NLP techniques and domain-specific ontologies, although our focus is on associated texts such as art historical surveys or curatorial essays rather than captions; unlike generic image search, such as in Google, we analyze beyond keywords and we use text which is specifically and clearly related to an image. For this project, we use the standard Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO) definition of subject metadata1 as including terms which provide “an identification, description, or interpretation of what is depicted in and by a work or image.”",,2009.0,8,3,"[{'authorId': '1761739', 'name': 'Judith L.

Three MapReduce algorithms are introduced: one based on brute force, a second where the problem is treated as large-scale ad hoc retrieval, and a third based on the Cartesian product of postings lists. Each algorithm supports one or more approximations that trade effectiveness for efficiency, the characteristics of which are studied experimentally. Results show that the brute force algorithm is the most efficient of the three when exact similarity is desired. However, the other two algorithms support approximations that yield large efficiency gains without significant loss of effectiveness.",Annual International ACM SIGIR Conference on Research and Development in Information Retrieval,2009.0,16,112,"[{'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

 Whether knowingly or otherwise, Wikipedia contributors reveal their interests and expertise through their contribution patterns. An analysis of Wikipedia edit histories shows that it is often possible to associate contributors with relatively small geographic regions, usually corresponding to where they were born or where they presently live. For many contributors, the geographic coordinates of pages they have edited are tightly clustered. Results suggest that a wealth of information about contributors can be gleaned from edit histories. This illustrates the efﬁcacy of data mining on large, publicly-available datasets and raises potential privacy concerns.

The eects of these stragglers include unnecessarily long wall-clock running times and sub-optimal cluster utilization. In many cases, this problem cannot simply be attributed to hardware idiosyncrasies, but is rather caused by the Zipan distribution of input or intermediate data. I present a simple theoretical model that shows how such distributions impose a fundamental limit on the amount of parallelism that can be extracted from a large class of algorithms where all occurrences of the same element must be processed together. A case study in parallel ad hoc query evaluation highlights the severity of the stragglers problem. Fortunately, a simple modication of the input data cuts end-to-end running time in half.

This work explores the use of memcached, an open-source distributed in-memory object caching system, to provide low-latency, high-throughput access to static global resources in Hadoop. Such a capability is essential to a large class of MapReduce algorithms that require, for example, querying language model probabilities, accessing model parameters in iterative algorithms, or performing joins across relational datasets. Experimental results on a simple demonstration application illustrate that memcached provides a feasible general-purpose solution for rapidly accessing global key-value pairs from within Hadoop programs. Our proposed architecture exhibits the desirable scaling characteristic of linear increase in throughput with respect to cluster size.

Parallelization of the model-building algorithms that process this data on computer clusters is fraught with challenges such as synchronization, data exchange, and fault tolerance. However, the MapReduce programming paradigm has recently emerged as one solution to these issues: a powerful functional abstraction hides system-level details from the researcher, allowing programs to be transparently distributed across potentially very large clusters of commodity hardware. We describe MapReduce implementations of two algorithms used to estimate the parameters for two word alignment models and one phrase-based translation model, all of which rely on maximum likelihood probability estimates.

While cluster computing has been available in commercial environments for several years, academic researchers have fallen behind in their ability to work on large datasets.

Hadoop, an open-source implementation of Google's MapReduce framework, provides a compelling solution to both issues. Its simple programming model hides system-level details from the developer, and its ability to run on commodity hardware puts cluster computing within the reach of many academic research groups.

Many current systems summarize texts by selecting sentences with important content. The limitation of extraction at the sentence level is that highly relevant sentences may also contain non-relevant and redundant content. 
This thesis presents a novel framework for text summarization that addresses the limitations of sentence-level extraction. Under this framework text summarization is performed by generating Multiple Alternative Sentence Compressions (MASC) as candidate summary components and using weighted features of the candidates to construct summaries from them. Sentence compression is the rewriting of a sentence in a shorter form. This framework provides an environment in which hypotheses about summarization techniques can be tested. 
Three approaches to sentence compression were developed under this framework. The first approach, HMM Hedge, uses the Noisy Channel Model to calculate the most likely compressions of a sentence. The second approach, Trimmer, uses syntactic trimming rules that are linguistically motivated by Headlinese, a form of compressed English associated with newspaper headlines. The third approach, Topiary, is a combination of fluent text with topic terms. 
The MASC framework for automatic text summarization has been applied to the tasks of headline generation and multi-document summarization, and has been used for initial work in summarization of novel genres and applications, including broadcast news, email threads, cross-language, and structured queries. The framework supports combinations of component techniques, fostering collaboration between development teams. 
Three results will be demonstrated under the MASC framework. The first is that an extractive summarization system can produce better summaries by automatically selecting from a pool of compressed sentence candidates than by automatically selecting from unaltered source sentences. The second result is that sentence selectors can construct better summaries from pools of compressed candidates when they make use of larger candidate feature sets. The third result is that for the task of Headline Generation, a combination of topic terms and compressed sentences performs better then either approach alone. Experimental evidence supports all three results.",,2007.0,88,13,"[{'authorId': '1752326', 'name': 'B. Dorr'}, {'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

Due to significant advances in answering simple fact-seeking questions, research is moving towards resolving complex questions. An approach adopted by many researchers is to decompose a complex question into a series of fact-seeking questions and reuse techniques developed for answering simple questions. This thesis presents an alternative novel approach to domain-specific complex question answering based on consistently applying a semantic domain model to question and document understanding as well as to answer extraction and generation. 
This study uses a semantic domain model of clinical medicine to encode (a) a clinician's information need expressed as a question on the one hand and (b) the meaning of scientific publications on the other to yield a common representation. It is hypothesized that this approach will work well for (1) finding documents that contain answers to clinical questions and (2) extracting these answers from the documents. 
The domain of clinical question answering was selected primarily because of its unparalleled resources that permit providing a proof by construction for this hypothesis. In addition, a working prototype of a clinical question answering system will support research in informed clinical decision making. The proposed methodology is based on the semantic domain model developed within the paradigm of Evidence Based Medicine. Three basic components of this model---the clinical task, a framework for capturing a synopsis of a clinical scenario that generated the question, and strength of evidence presented in an answer---are identified and discussed in detail. 
Algorithms and methods were developed that combine knowledge-based and statistical techniques to extract the basic components of the domain model from abstracts of biomedical articles. These algorithms serve as a foundation for the prototype end-to-end clinical question answering system that was built and evaluated to test the hypotheses. 
Evaluation of the system on test collections developed in the course of this work and based on real life clinical questions demonstrates feasibility of complex question answering and high accuracy information retrieval using a semantic domain model.",,2006.0,159,16,"[{'authorId': '1737250', 'name': 'Douglas W.

Together, these elements comprise a PICO frame.

This paper evaluates the adequacy and suitability of PICO frames as a knowledge representation by analyzing 59 real-world primary-care clinical questions. We discovered that only two questions in our corpus contain all four PICO elements, and that 37% of questions contain both intervention and outcome. Our study reveals prevalent structural patterns for the four types of clinical questions: therapy, diagnosis, prognosis, and etiology. We found that the PICO framework is primarily centered on therapy questions, and is less suitable for representing other types of clinical information needs. Challenges in mapping natural language questions into PICO structures are also discussed.

This distinction holds important implications for the TREC scoring model---essentially, systems only receive credit for retrieving vital nuggets---and is a source of evaluation instability. The upshot is that for many questions in the TREC testsets, the median score across all submitted runs is zero.

Although previous experiments have not conclusively demonstrated performance gains resulting from such interactions, it is unclear whether these findings speak to the nature of clarification dialogs, or simply the limitations of current systems. To probe the limits of such interactions, we employed a human intermediary to formulate clarification questions and exploit user responses. In addition to establishing a plausible upper bound on performance, we were also able to induce an ""ontology of clarifications"" to characterize human behavior. This ontology, in turn, serves as the input to a regression model that attempts to determine which types of clarification questions are most helpful.

The goal of our preliminary work is to model the linguistic contents of the arguments presented by the petitioners and respondents, as captured in the original litigants’ briefs and the amici briefs submitted in these two cases. In particular, we are interested in the types of words and phrases used by both sides in order to forward their arguments. These linguistic cues may provide us with insight into the policy and ideological inclinations of the parties involved. We utilize and compare two analytical methods, an adaptation of the Wordscoring technique first developed by Laver, Benoit, and Garry (2003) and a Naive Bayes’ classifier to identify commonalities in documents and group them accordingly.

Although the dominance of Web search contributes to reinforcement of this behavior, the inability for retrieval systems to take advantage of more expressive query representations is also a culprit. Short queries pose a challenge to designers of information retrieval systems for a number of reasons: At the linguistic level, they often contain polysemous words that are difficult to disambiguate without appropriate contextual cues. At a higher level, short queries do not provide clues regarding the broader activities that give rise to the user’s information need. There is reason to believe that if a computer system were able to solicit richer queries from a user, it might be able to build a better model of the information seeking process, thereby leading to higher retrieval performance—for example, Hearst [8] has shown that faceted queries can be converted into simple post-filtering constraints to boost precision. Note, however, that “richer” queries do not necessarily mean natural language descriptions—in fact, language processing technology is not yet sufficiently advanced to capture the intricacies of free text for document retrieval. Instead, we believe that a more fruitful approach is to focus on structured representations of information needs that better capture the different aspects of the information seeking process. The idea that “bags of words” are poor query representations is by no means new. Even before the invention of computers, librarians have long known that retrieval should be performed at the conceptual level. More recently, Belkin’s work on anomalous states of knowledge [3] brought this to the attention of information retrieval researchers. The idea that IR systems serve to bring different cognitive representations “into alignment” has also been explored within the framework of cognitive information retrieval [9]. We recognize the difficulty in designing query representa-",,2005.0,13,6,"[{'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J. Lin'}, {'authorId': '1398175407', 'name': 'Dina Demner-Fushman'}]"

A lexicon organized in this fashion contains much redundant information and is unable to capture cross-categorial morphological derivations. The solution is to spread the ""semantic load"" of lexical entries to other morphemes not typically taken to bear semantic content. This approach follows current trends in linguistic theory, and more perspicuously accounts for alternations in argument structure.

My framework is based on the assumption that the proper representation of argument structure is event structure. Furthermore, I develop the hypothesis that event structure is syntactic structure, and argue that verb meanings are compositionally derived in the syntax from verbalizing heads, functional elements that license eventive interpretations, and verbal roots, abstract concepts drawn from encyclopedic knowledge. The overall goal of the enterprise is to develop a theory that is able to transparently relate the structure and meaning of verbal arguments. By hypothesis, languages share the same inventory of primitive building blocks and are governed by the same set of constraints—all endowed by principles of Universal Grammar and subjected to parametric variations. Support for my theory is drawn from both Mandarin Chinese and English. In particular, the organization of the Mandarin verbal system provides strong evidence for the claim that activity and state are the only two primitive verb types in Chinese— achievements and accomplishments are syntactically-derived complex categories. As a specific instance of complex event composition, I examine Mandarin resultative verb compounds and demonstrate that a broad range of variations can be perspicuously captured in my framework. I show that patterns of argument sharing in these verbal compounds can be analyzed as control, thus grounding argument structure in wellknown syntactic constraints such as the Minimum Distance Principle. Finally, I argue that cross-linguistic differences in the realization of verbal arguments can be reduced to variations in the way functional elements interact with verbal roots. Overall, my work not only contributes to our understanding of how events are syntactically represented, but also explicates interactions at the syntax-semantics interface, clarifying the relationship between surface form, syntactic structure, and logical form.

While our overall architecture remained largely unchanged from last year, we have built on our strengths for each component: our web-based factoid engine was adapted for input from a new web search engine; our list engine’s knowledge base expanded from 150 to over 3000 lists; our definitional nugget extractor now has expanded and improved patterns with improved component precision and recall. Beyond their internal improvements, these components were adapted to a larger conversational framework that passed information about the topic1 to factoids and lists. Answer selection for definitional2 questions newly took into account the prior questions and answers for duplicate removal. Our factoid engine, Aranea (Lin et al., 2002; Katz et al., 2003), used the World Wide Web to find candidate answers to the given question, and then projects its best candidates onto the corpus, choosing the one best supported. This year, instead of using only Google for web search, we integrated results from the Teoma search engine as well.

An exploration of this question is our overall research goal. In this paper, we specically examine strategies for coping with morphological variation. This work quantitatively compares two dieren t approaches to handling term variation: applying a stemming algorithm at indexing time, and performing morphological query expansion at retrieval time. We discovered that, compared to the no-stemming baseline, stemming results in lower recall, and morphological expansion yields higher recall. By separately weighting dieren t term variants, we were able to achieve even higher recall, which opens the door to interesting question analysis algorithms for sophisticated query generation.

We believe that achieving high performance in the question answering task requires a combination of multiple strategies designed to capitalize on different characteristics of various resources. The system we deployed for the TREC evaluation last year relied exclusively on the World Wide Web to answer factoid questions (Lin et al., 2002). The advantages that the Web offers are well known and have been exploited by previous systems (Brill et al., 2001; Clarke et al., 2001; Dumais et al., 2002). The immense amount of freely available unstructured text provides data redundancy, which can be leveraged with simple pattern matching techniques involving the expected answer formulations. In many ways, we can utilize huge quantities of data to overcome many thorny problems in natural language processing such as lexical ambiguity and paraphrases. Furthermore, Web search engines such as Google provide a convenient front-end for accessing and filtering enormous amounts of Web data. We have identified this class of techniques as the knowledge mining approach to question answering (Lin and Katz, 2003). In addition to viewing the Web as a repository of unstructured documents, we can also take advantage of structured and semistructured sources available on the Web using knowledge annotation techniques (Katz, 1997; Lin and Katz, 2003). Through empirical analysis of real world natural language questions, we have noticed that large classes of commonly occurring queries can be parameterized and captured using a simple object–property–value data model (Katz et al., 2002). Furthermore, such a data model is easy to impose on Web resources through a framework of wrapper scripts. These techniques allow our system to view the Web as if it were a “virtual database” and use knowledge contained therein to answer user questions. While the Web is undeniably a useful resource for question answering, it is not without drawbacks. Useful knowledge on the Web is often drowned out by the sheer amount of irrelevant material, and statistical techniques are often insufficient to separate right answers from wrong ones. Overcoming these obstacles will require addressing many outstanding issues in computational linguistics: anaphora resolution, paraphrase normalization, temporal reference calculation, and lexical disambiguation, just to name a few. Furthermore, the setup of the TREC evaluations necessitates an extra step in the question answering process for systems that extract answers from external sources, typically known as answer projection. For every Web-derived answer, a system must find a supporting document from the AQUAINT corpus, even if the corpus was not used in the answer extraction process. This year’s main task included definition and list questions in addition to factoid questions. Although Web-based techniques have proven effective in handling factoid questions, they are less applicable to tackling definition and list questions. The datadriven approach implicitly assumes that each natural language question has a unique answer. Since a single answer instance is sufficient, algorithms were designed to trade recall for precision. For list and definition questions, however, a more balanced approach is required, since multiple answers are not only desired, but necessary. We believe that the best strategy is to integrate Web-based approaches with more traditional question answering techniques driven by document retrieval and named-entity detection. Corpusand Web-based strategies should play complementary roles in an overall question answering framework.",Text Retrieval Conference,2003.0,15,70,"[{'authorId': '6104312', 'name': 'Boris Katz'}, {'authorId': '145580839', 'name': 'Jimmy J.

However, the Resource Description Framework (RDF), the foundation of the Semantic Web, was designed to be easily processed by computers, not humans.

The ternary expressions that we use are not only linguistically-motivated, but also amenable to rapid large-scale indexing. REXTOR (Relations EXtracTOR) is an implementation of this model; in one uniform framework, the system provides two separate grammars for extracting arbitrary patterns of text and building ternary expressions from them.

To handle these constructions, which include numbers, dates, addresses, etc., and, to a lesser extent, proper nouns, NL systems typically implement specialized new rules. This leads to a level of complexity which renders maintenance or improvement difficult. Analyzing and tokenizing these constructions with an independent preprocessor can alleviate the burden on already taxed systems. Because these constructions have highly regular forms, strict structure, and can be largely understood in the absence of context, it is possible to shift the burden of processing away from the primary parser, and onto a simpler, faster, non-linguistic preprocessor. This paper describes Blitz, a hybrid database- and heuristic-based natural language preprocessor, which has been integrated into the START Natural Language System in order to demonstrate how non-linguistic preprocessing can improve parsing. As a result, START’s ability to analyze real-world sentences has improved considerably.

This paper focuses on optimizing the runtime performance of applying such models to make predictions, specifically using gradient-boosted regression trees for learning to rank. Although exceedingly simple conceptually, most implementations of tree-based models do not efficiently utilize modern superscalar processors. By laying out data structures in memory in a more cache-conscious fashion, removing branches from the execution flow using a technique called predication, and micro-batching predictions using a technique called vectorization, we are able to better exploit modern processor architectures. Experiments on synthetic data and on three standard learning-to-rank datasets show that our approach is significantly faster than standard implementations.",,,36,62,"[{'authorId': '1858497', 'name': 'N.

Sentence trimming was incorporated into a feature-based summarization system, called Multi-Document Trimmer (MDT), by using sentence trimming as both a pre-processing stage and a feature for sentence ranking. We demonstrate that we were able to port Trimmer easily to this new problem, although the impact of sentence trimming was minimal compared to other features used in the system. The performance of our system in the official MSE2005 task was around the middle of the pack (16 out of 27). After some minor bug fixes and a simple correction (dateline removal) we obtained an improvement on a post-hoc run on the test data.",,,10,1,"[{'authorId': '3192273', 'name': 'David M.
